                ","This will go down as the greatest Indian films ever, Storyline was more sublime than ever Grand performance from Yash, bit illogical fights but yes anything comes under fiction and if you're getting a story like this then nothing comes close KGF 2 - surely A MASTERPIECE."

                ","KGF Chapter 1 movie was just a Trailer, But this movie is a feast. Prashanth Neel kept his words and wrote such a Marvellous script. Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie. Better I recommend them to watch love story/ Family Sentiment movies rather than Action Movies like KGF Chapter 2.

Ps: The spoiler is Achyuth Kumar, who played the role of Gurupandian is the main Antagonist, not Sanjay Dutt."

                ","As expected, KGF 2 is getting positive response and sure there's a possibility a box office tsunami and set record.

In addition, KGF 2 will be the best Kannada film ever. Sorry to say haters, film will be blockbuster.

The plus points are Yash, music and BGM, Prashanth Neel direction and climax.

The minus points are runtime, some illogical scenes and weak villain.

Once again, Yash has given fantastic performance and wins the hearts of the viewers. Hats off to them for making the best Kannada film ever.

Hence, it will probably became the best Indian film of 2022 since RRR."

                ","The screenplay, cuts and sound effects deserves a standing ovation. There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie. There is hardly any sugarcoating to the criminal angle of Rocky, and it is more of a man with a promise to fulfill. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a honest 'masala movie'!!"

                ","""Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet."" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.

KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).

The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.

One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022."

                ","KGF - Chapter 1, set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.

The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down.

The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time.

This film gets to showcase the emotional side of Rocky too, with a love story and even some glimpses into his past life that fuelled his ambition. The love story doesn't take away too much from the tale either. One of the best shots in the film is the introduction of Adheera played by Sanjay Dutt. It is pure magic on screen and evokes whistles organically. Raveena Tandon as the Prime Minister also has a good track. The other interesting addition is Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer. Prakash Raj also makes for a good narrator, with his baritone adding an immersive experience.

The film belongs as much to filmmaker Prashanth Neel as it does to Yash. Both of them have managed to deliver a sequel that seems more immersive than the first part. Albeit, Prashanth has always maintained that the second part had the bigger chunk of his original story when they decided to break it into two parts.

For the audience who wants to watch a loaded action film with style, heavy-duty stunts, and dialogues, this one is simply made to order. KGF: Chapter 2 might not appeal to the seemingly woke audience, who would question consent or nitpick on commercial staples like violence. But for those who love such films, here's an essential spoiler, as there is a hint at a possible third chapter in the end credits, so wait until the end."

                ","KFF part 2- Boisterous, loud and machismo type effect, taking Kannada movie to great heights.

Almost realistic barring few errors, the strong story line is displayed with bullet train speed, tight screenplay and stunning dialogues.

Key characters have been given equal weight and power- that's the best part.

Raveena shines as a tigress and pounds heavily. Sanjay Dutt plays his role well.

Yash steals the show with his charisma and he is the REAL GOLD. His confidence and dialogue delivery is clap worthy.

                ","Right through K. G. F: Chapter 2, I couldn't help but imagine what it must have been like for Prashant Neel to watch The Godfather for the first time. More than the whole film, I'd love to ask him someday about the impact its climax left him with as he watched it in what I imagine to be an old theatre, wherever he grew up. Like the iconic theatre scene in Cinema Paradiso, this moment must have been Prashanth's big life-altering moment, his metamorphosis where he not only discovered the magic of movies but also the concept of ""mass"" before it became a thing. Without sounding too dramatic, something must have clicked in him because there's no one here who thinks in intercuts like this man.

                ","OMG. What did I just watch! KGF Chapter 2 is a blistering, adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes sequel to what was an era-defining part 1 that propelled not just Prashant Neel and superstar Yash but also the entire Kannada film industry, into national prominence. The team has clearly made the best use of the higher budget it received after the first film's success, keeping the emotional resonance from the original intact and building elaborate, well written and intelligently shot and edited mass elevation scenes that will keep you clamouring for more till the awe-inspiring climax.

We rejoin our hero, Rocky Bhai as he takes over control of the Kolar Gold Fields after having killed the demonic ""Garuda"" in the first film, only to have an entire can of worms open up as a consequence with everyone ranging from Garuda's vengeful uncle ""Adheera"" (Sanjay Dutt) to the Prime Minister of India ""Ravika"" (Raveena Tandon) training their sights on his lucrative fiefdom. Director Prashant Neel gets his casting choices spot on with both these Bollywood biggies bringing in their A-game as menacing antagonists that hold their own against Yash's sheer swag and star power.

The void left by legendary Kannada actor Anand Nat opting not to return to the franchise due to personal reasons was ably filled by National-award winner Prakash Raj, while the rest of the returning cast play their roles with flourish, especially Ayyappa P Sharma as ""Vanaram"", Harish Rai as ""Khasim"", Achyuth Kumar as ""Guru Pandian"" and Govinda Gowda as the cheeky ""office assistant"". Srinidhi Shetty is nondescript as Rocky Bhai's love interest ""Reena"", with their romance track bordering on an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome, being the only hiccup in an otherwise flawless mass masala entertainer.

Prashant Neel's ability to smoothly intercut the main timeline with flashbacks to Rocky Bhai's childhood means that the mother character, played ably by Archana Jois, makes an even more emotionally endearing impact on Chapter 2, with the mother-son bond continuing to be the glue that holds together what would otherwise have been a shallow massy outing.

Prashant Neel has made creating innovative mass elevation sequences an art form and with a star of Yash's natural badassery and swagger as his foil, the auteur has clearly cut loose with the sheer scale and scope of his sets rising to earthshattering levels, without sacrificing on ingenuity and the ability to catch the audience by surprise. The intro sequences of our three primary characters, played by Yash, Dutt and Tandon are choreographed with pinpoint precision to evoke maximum mass impact and are custom-made to play to each performer's strengths. While Neel uses Dutt's eyes and hulky silhouette to portray his beastly and brutal nature, with Tandon, he resorts to using minimal hand and facial gestures to showcase the sheer unspoken power wielded by her character, inspired by India's Iron Lady, Indira Gandhi herself.

And what can I say about Yash that hasn't been already said? Irrepressible swag, a natural coyness and obnoxious body language mean he is a natural fit as the morally ambiguous gangster and it is this very nature that adds to the unpredictability of the KGF universe with the audience constantly on the ropes, unable to guess or comprehend what the crazy mafioso will do next. Music director Ravi Basrur carries on the same rich vein as in the first part, elevating each punch sequence with layers of feeling and goosebumps, switching over effortlessly from the massy highs of ""Sulthana"" to the emotionally wrought ""Thannane"".

""KGF Chapter 2"" stands head and shoulders over other recent Indian blockbuster fan service mass vehicles like ""Pushpa (2021)"" and ""RRR (2022)"" because of the editing and staging prowess of its director, with seemingly unrelenting action and a narrative that constantly keeps you guessing and on a knife-edge. A mandatory theatre watch! Highly, highly recommended! And don't forget to catch the post-credits scene!"

Entire cast lived upto the role and more.

Yash penned down most of his dialogues which are on a whole new level.

Writing of the movie, DOP, Costumes, and most importantly Background Score puts this piece of the movie in the list of masterpieces india produced.

Mother sentiment worked well in this one too except not as frequent as chapter 1.

This movie has all traits of chapter 1 only difference is that they are enhanced, amplified and worked even better.

Action sequences are very wisely choreographed.

                ","KGF Chapter 2 is bigger, bolder, better and densely packed engaging screenplay and ofcourse dialogues that elevate emotions.

Especially considering it as a genre of Indian action film for the masses, this film not just surpasses expectations in quality of writing and making. It in itself sets a benchmark far beyond anything seen before.

The soundtrack is phenomenal and aids in conveying the apt emotions at the right time esp the switch of soundtracks between violent action scenes and the mother-son flashbacks.

Action scenes is as good if nt better than prequel.

Essentially KGF is the story of an ambitious strong mother and a fierce son determined enough to defeat the world to keep his promise to her.

One of the finest well made action films in world cinema."

Sanjay dutt did a commendable job and they embraced the Vikings reference! Production design is out of this world and can be compared to few of the Hollywood movies. Cinematography by Bhuvan Gowda is also very good! BGM is always in perfect sync! The romance angle was bit forced, cringy and sometimes it crosses the line (the entertainment dialogue, the only dialogue which didn't get any whistle from the audience!). But speaking of entertainment, if you want a entertaining movie packed with well choreographed action, go watch it on theater soon and don't wait for OTT release."

                ","The people who fell in love with the first chapter, I can safely say that they are in for an absolute delight. It's bigger, better and more grand in the truest sense of the word! Prashant Neel knew what the fans wished for and he duly delivers. With electrifying Cinematography, phenomenal background score and a surplus of action set pieces, it's nothing but an Action Junky's dream come true.

Regardless, speaking of my personal opinion on it, I did enjoy my time in the theatres, and did take a strong liking to whatever this had in its offerings; However, I wasn't fully sold on it.

Halt the hate train and just let me clarify...

I have mainly two criticisms, one is about the forceful incorporation of romance (which was mostly counterproductive) and the other one is a somewhat loose portrayal of Sanjay Dutt as ""Adheera"". Just try to remember what Prashant Neel previously did with Ramachandra Raju as Garuda. That character, not only looked ferocious and frightening he also talked evil, acted evil, and the whole aura around him was appalling to say the very least.

Now when it comes to Adheera, the impression is quite distinct. Don't get me wrong, he still is efficient enough and Mr Dutt played the role remarkably well, it's just that his character appeared more like a murderous, bloodthirsty warrior (inspired by Viking traditions) than a vicious, vile adversary against our lead protagonist.

For Srinidhi Shetty (as Reena); My qualms are a little different. I would not put the entire blame on her, as she did whatever the director had made her do. It's her character, or the writing rather, that leaves much to be desired. On a side note, I admire what they did with Ramika Sen; she's fierce, desperate and very much to the point. Needless to say, Raveena Tandon did an incredible job as well.

Looking at how my review had gone so far, you guys might be having some doubts regarding my judgements, well, don't get any wrong ideas cause I wholeheartedly appreciate the film for what it is and what it represents. And the main reason for my fondness goes to Yash aka Rocky!

I'm telling you, this man is something else. I have seen lots of superstars over the years but none come remotely close to what Yash brings to the table. His magnetic personality, the specific way in which he delivers his lines, and the undeniable charisma that he possesses; it's truly one of a kind, unparalleled in every sense."

                ","The ambition of the movie KGF is kind of like its lead character Rocky Bhai which is to conquer whatever is possible. Chapter 1 not only made sure Kannada movie industry on the map, but also led to the start of filmmakers taking pan India releases seriously. This was just because of the sheer quality of dubbing, right partnerships and promotion efforts while releasing in other languages. Finally, when KGF Chapter 2 is hitting the screens 3.5 years after its predecessor the cinema lovers across India also across some parts of the world have embraced it with love. KGF is complex and detailed filmmaking at its best for a gangster action drama. Director Prashant Neel's attention to detail is what makes it stand out from the rest of action/drama movies. With only 3 films under his belt in the last 8 years, it looks like he has already established his brand of filmmaking.

While the first part showed us the rise of Rocky bhai after dethroning Garuda in KGF, the plot of the second part is slightly more complex and political. Chapter 2's narration is almost like a biopic of an actual gangster (or should I say monster :P). The movie keeps you hooked frame by frame and almost makes you feel a part of the world of KGF. Cinematography, art direction and the background score elevate almost every scene to a different level. Adheera's introduction scene involving his entry into Rocky's territory starts literally by ""burning bridges"". This is just a sample of many cleverly executed scenes throughout the movie.

The dark sepia kind of tone with barely any colourful visuals perfectly suits director's narrative. The action sequences have been executed and edited more like art and haven't gone unnecessarily over the top. One of the fight scenes which is barely relevant to the plot still makes for a great watch just because of the background narration and the camerawork. The dialogue writing continues to impress, and it is one of the best I have seen in Kannada cinema in my lifetime. The songs may seem like almost a continuation of part 1 music, but the visual treatment of them makes you hum and cheer along. There is a brilliant mini recreation of part 1 in the song 'Toofan' and it is probably one of the best example of Neel's genius execution.

The KGF franchise has focused a lot on each and individual characters. Irrespective of how big/small the role is almost each of them gets a narration and introduction of their own. This turns out to be both a blessing and a curse, especially in this movie. The character arc for some roles turns out to be slightly abrupt, but I guess it is the sacrifice director must make for the optimal running time. This does not affect Rocky Bhai's character and the evolution from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 is handled seamlessly. Yash's dialogue delivery as Rocky will forever be a trademark of its own. Almost every line of Rocky bhai's character is a punch dialogue and Yash delivers them all in style without seeming to be jarring. He brings shades of Al Pacino from Scarface at times. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera has a great screen presence as an antagonist but somehow his character lacks a strong conflict with the lead and a detailed backstory to establish his purpose better. Srinidhi Shetty does get a longer screen time and she does more than a decent job with very few lines. Her character towards the end turns out to be a bit too mainstream and I believe that was planned by the director keeping a certain section of the audience in mind. Prashant Neel has very cleverly handled Raveena Tandon's dubbing and has not tried to force her lip sync in Kannada. This also serves the purpose of her being in Delhi as the Prime Minister. All other supporting characters contribute their bit to movie's elevating moments. Harish Rai as Chacha is a very well written old school supporting character and hats off to the director for creating a right mix of veteran and new age Kannada movie actors.

KGF Chapter 2 is more than just a mass entertainer. It is the perfect artistic execution of the story of a movie and credit has to be given to all its departments. It is an event to witness in one's lifetime and if you are a Kannadiga, you'd be walking out of the theatre beaming with pride."

                ","HONEST REVIEW FROM A NOT A FAN OF YASH!

Just like KGF 1, KGF 2 is also extremely over the top so if you were a fan of KGF before , then only choose this film. Just don't go watch KGF 2 just because of the hype and stuff, watch KGF 1 first..see if you liked it then go for 2nd part as this film caters mostly to young audience and die hard fans of masala films.

KGF 2 can be easily excused for its over the top nature solely because of some terrific performances and interesting story telling. It is exactly the same storytelling like KGF 1 but director Neel takes it one step above. It is this interesting storytelling that held my attention in part 1 and even now in part 2.

The BGM is just earthquake inducing ..it's extremely loud but it's so electrifying that it elevates any scene where Yash would be present. I personally enjoyed the BGM. Dialogues are again those typical chest thumping ones from what you expect from South India. But they are hard hitting and good to hear. Especially from Yash's mother.

Filled with tons of whistle/clap worthy scenes be it Yash or Sanju baba both have got some terrific dialogues that induce whistles.

Performances. Everyone has done a fantastic job be it the lead or the side actors .

Cinematography and setting of this film is just top class. Definitely you can feel the green screen background at places but whats in front of that green screen is just mesmerizing. Rustic and raw looking . The mines are so well set that grayish tone and everything gives that rustic look. Highly impressed.

Climax battle is a treat. All hell break loose. That final battle felt like I was watching some battle from some kingdom film where two kings from two kingdoms are fighting. Absolute treat for masala lovers. Fires coming out as Adheera and Rocky proceed to clash is just extraordinary to watch. Full value for money scene.

Negatives - a section no 10/10 reviewer would tell you but I'll highlight them. 1. Stretched ending 2. Some hilarious fight sequences. I am not a die hard fan of any south film so when I see such action, it definitely looks super exciting but at the same time definitely makes me laugh at least once. 3. An absolute not needed romantic song in the 2nd half that Unnecessarily increases the length of the film further which already is stretched at the end. 4. In 1st half there is a car chase sequence (that imo looked exactly like the one from the climax of Race 3 lol) . The way it is shot, in start-stop manner , didnt like it. Would have enjoyed a full sequence rather than that start-stop fashion . Also, wait, wait. There is a scene at the very last related to Rocky it looked exactly inspired from James Bond : no time to die ending sequence.

Overall, if you are a die hard masala film fan or even if you loved KGF 1, then you cannot miss KGF 2. You pay 200rs or 1700rs for the most expensive cinema, you will feel totally satisfied.

PS - I don't glorify/ celebrate films like these."

                ","The story and screenplay of KGF 2 is awesome in one word. One scene after another inside the movie is so good and gives so much goosebump that the body will tremble at the sight. There are scenes like this in a movie that I have never seen before. I have never seen such scenes in Hollywood movies. Yash's entry scenes in the film - Adheera's entry scenes, action scenes, climax scenes, and even the post-credit scene are awesome. I salute the director of the film Prashanth Neel for giving such a movie as a gift. There is no hero to my knowledge that anyone can match the style, attitude, dialogue delivery expression of the hero of the film Yash. The heroine of the film Srinidhi Shetty's acting in the movie is very good. No one else can do the character that Sanjay Dutt has done as a villain in such a beautiful way. Raveena Tandon's performance is very remarkable and she has acted in a powerful character. The background music is even better which has helped a lot to enhance the movie. Complete family 'movie. No boring scenes. Everyone should see. If no one sees this movie then he will make a big mistake in his life. The movie is one of the best movies in the Indian film industry."

                ","I am a big fan of KGF 1 but I am totally lost after watching KGF 2. Movie look like 2h 48m trailer. The way movie is edited looks like the whole movie as a trailer. Worst editing at car chase scene. While the chase scene is happening the screen blanks out and scene start somewhere , it will happen through out the chase scene . Too much narration unnecessary flashback cut scenes at unnecessary times makes you feel like watching big trailer. Omg about music it's worst. The sounds makes you irritating and may cause pain in the years that too in your left ear. The story starts at one point and it turns in a loop of worst edited fights flashback cuts and noisy sounds. In The climax fight scene the camera man made a great work you cannot figure out what the stunt master designed , camera moves constantly its like fast-forwaring the VCR casset. Only some scene and Cinematography is good."

                ","Bhaut Jyada Expectations lekar gya tha movie dekhne par .... KGF >> Kgf2 Chapter 2

Postives -

Yash ki terrific performance, stylish Look, Raw Aur Rugged Swag, Uske Style mai Bole Gye Simple Dialogues Bhi Jabardast Thai, And Uski Energy Aur Intensity Movie Ko Full Paisa Vasool Banati hai.

Sanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Sanjay Ki Intensity And Rocky Aur Adheera ke bich Outstanding Fight Sequence.

Raveena ki Performance Aur Srinidhi Ki Performance

The standout stunts included Yash's introduction, the action sequence before the interval and scenes that come up after the interval, and the heavy-duty climax. The stunt choreography is sensational.

Okay Ye sab toh Postive point thai but mujhe lga movie ko Bhaut Fast Mode pe bnaya gya, Fast Screenplay ne story ka impact kam kr diya , Ye 2 Movies ki Story Ban Sakti thi Jise Prasanth neel ne 1 Movie mai Jabardasti Ghusa diya Mujhe lgta hai is story mai bhaut potential tha iski 2 Movies definitely ban sakti thi

Adheera ke character ki backstory se Uske Character ko deep dikhaya ja sakta THA.

Sab kuch Fast mode mai hua,car chasing scene better ho sakta tha uske baad Rocky ko goli lagi, ek din baad woh uth gya, Aur bhi chije thi jinhe Sahi trike se dikhaya ja sakta tha

And One thing Jab kgf Chapter 1 mai Reena ko rocky se pyar ho hi gya tha toh Chapter 2 ki shuruwat mai use phir se nafrat kaise hui.

Kaash neel ne movie ko trilogy bnaya hota, jis se is movie Ko Sahi Speed se Banaya jata. KGF Mai Jo Storytelling Thi Woh is part se Door rahi

Overall movie theatrical Experience ke Liye Bhaut Achi hai Aur Mass Audience Ko Pura Entertainment Dene wali Hai."

                ","Written and directed by Prasanth Neel who made people anxious and crazy about his love for the character of Rocky from KGF 1 finally arrives in theatres after a long gap of almost 3 and a half years. Well arrival is such an understatement for this movie, it shreds the box office like anything you have previously seen on a big screen. I have never seen fans so anxious and crazy about a movie since Avengers finale and I have got to tell you that this is the most overwhelming movie experience I have had of any Indian Movie in cinemas ever period. People were literally shouting and cheering even before the Big title showed on the screen and it definitely marks the greatest entrance of a character in a movie. Not to mention I went to the last show possible in the theatre near me and I wasn't expecting it to be houseful at midnight but God am I glad to be wrong.

What I really liked about this movie over RRR recently is the inclusion of Bollywood actors ( Sanju Baba and Raveena Tandon) in pivotal roles which I felt were shoehorned in the RRR Movie but are of paramount importance here and leave their mark in style.

The charm and magnetic presence of rocking star Yash is undeniable and the swag 😎 with He carries this character can't be replaced with anyone else helming this iconic role.

I was amazed to see how they pulled of such visuals and set pieces with a budget of mere 100 crore (although you do see some noticable VFX or cuts in production here and now).

The best thing I really appreciate about this movie is the fact that it is a sequel and a quintessential in that regard. It's been so long since I have seen a sequel that completely overshadows its predecessor with such a novelty and surpasses all the expectations. While Raving about this I might add this this one is not without it's setbacks (although minor) which do not bring down movie much but sure could be enhanced in the 3rd installment with some addition to the budget constraints.

The editing still feels a bit choppy but not as jarring to look at when compared to it's predecessor where it was hard to comprehend what's going on the screen no matter how hard you try. The BGM here is loud again ( not for the faint hearted) but appropriate to the story and only adds to the screenplay. The romantic angle feels forced and could have been avoided but I do understand that this one is Emotion centric at core so they had to include that and it does pay off in the end when the showdown between the two nutheads begin.

Well I got in it for the story telling perspective and not for the action sequences but I do want to confess that some action sequences are so well choreographed that you will be left in awe especially the Kashnikov scene (you will understand when it comes). The story here is less Messier and more linear than the first one makes the backbone of this monstercoaster of a ride.

Do watch in theatres with biggest crowd possible (you will thank me later).

Magnum Opus of Kannada movie Industry indeed.

VERDICT: 4.5/5."

                ","I really didn't excited about this movie. I watched its part 1 only one time 3 year ago but not paying interest as other movie. I usually didn't watch hall dubbed version but i haven't any expectations and excitement from this so i watched hall print. But after i watch i feel i should have watch part 1 to know properly about its story. And i feel i should have wait for hd release. Before reviewing this i watched part 2. I also like part 2 as mass entertainment. Its story is somehow good not a masterpieces as people say it's just average decent one.

Those who didn't watch i recommended you to watch in theater just watch for enjoyment and keep aside logic in some action part and other scen to enjoy it."

                ","My honest opinion is that, this movie is just like the first chapter, no more no less. With its hype, we had a very high expectations but it could not meet those expectations. This does not mean the movie is disappointing, everything is just like the its previous chapter and I enjoyed each and every part of it. This movie is totally worth watching for its scale, dialogue and action. Don't have any expectations. No expectations, no disappointment. I personally wish, something had to be different for it to become a masterpiece.

                ","I normally don't write Spoiler reviews. But it's truly frustrating that so many people are rating this movie 10/10. While the movie doesn't deserve higher than an average of 6.

K. G. F. Chapter 1 was one of the best movies of Indian Cinema. It had a strong script that built the character of Rocky as well as utilized him smartly. Direction was artistic. Scenes of several different times and locations were showed in continuous slides with dialogues from different people intermingled to deliver the message in a very exotic way. Instead of telling the story linear and chronologically, it had done that dynamically with scenes at places that made those exciting as well as fun to watch. That was indeed 10/10. I've watched it 7 times.

This second part, however, seems poor imitation of its own first part. Immensely huge population is rating it high because of the hype created and the wait for two additional years for this movie. And for that they're deeply feeling the Charisma of Rocky, which the movie has delivered well. But the truth is, many things that made the first chapter great are entirely missing here. Director have failed to use the same artistic style appropriately, and in fact, most of the movie is told chronologically. Not that it's a bad thing, because most movies have chronological story-telling. But due to this the story of this second chapter became more important. And sadly, the script of this chapter is extremely poor. Numerous actions and character reactions felt absurd and unrealistic. Several character motivations were destroyed by extended details.

Rocky's romance chemistry is also made extremely weaker, even though lot more time is spent on this compared to the first chapter. In previous chapter it was established that Reena had already fallen in love with Rocky. And all Rocky needed to do is ask her to go with him, as she could have become a target for hurting Rocky. Hence, her life could be in danger outside KGF. She would surely not have denied, and in fact, would have went with him happily. Doing that would have also brought him Rajendar Desai as his alliance, which would have helped him greatly. But what he did here is kidnap Reena and keep her in KGF forcefully, which resulted in her loss of her love and respect for him. What most people don't understand, the positive feelings she later felt could be due to Stockholm Syndrome, which many victims of Kidnapping suffer with. Hence, whatever romance build later showed that resulted in her pregnancy was to out of affection for him but because of her desire to be loved by her Kidnapper.

All the villains in the movie are used poorly. Adheera's character is given scary getup and personality. But his actions do not scare as much as Garoda did in first part. He's told to be extremely cruel and heartless and such. And what he does in the best opportunity to kill Rocky? He wastes that opportunity himself by sending Rocky. And the reason? He wants the people to see their beloved to die in their hands. Same affect could have been achieved in a far better way, and with zero risks involved if he would have send them his dead body. Those twenty thousand people were showed to be extremely scared of Adheera already. Watching Rocky's dead boy would have destroyed their morale completely. They would have surrendered as soon as Adheera's army would have landed there. So, the actual reason Adheera didn't kill Rocky was because the script didn't want Rocky to die at the moment, and the script writers could not come up with a better idea of keeping Rocky alive.

Ramika's character was wasted in a big way. Although she delivered some very good few punch-line dialogues in the movie, she was eventually showed as an idiot politician and PM of India. Why the hell would she want to bomb the entire KGF? She had sent the Indian army there. She could have brought control over those fields and continued mining gold for the government. It is showed that her intentions were to avoid releasing details of the company delivering money to everyone in her surrounding, including her own party's fund. But surely this could have been done in a lot smarter way compared to bombing and destroying a land full of gold. Although the movie suggest Rocky had already mined all (or most of) gold from those lands, she didn't know this. Besides, this could be wrong prediction as well. There could be more gold in that land. And after bombing that entire zone, what she did? She left he land completely, instead of working out if there was any gold somewhere.

In Chapter 1 there were several characters who brought some dramatic impact. There was a mad man who talked rubbish and told stories, but those stories had connections to the heroism of Rocky. There were also two elderly men who worked as leaders/elders/supervisors of the slaves of KGF. There were also other characters from the slaves, like the ones who died for saving Rocky. Presence of these characters connected the viewers with the slaves of KGF. In chapter 2, all these characters removed. A combo of mother and son was brought forth to bring some dramatic impact, but that combo failed to bring real emotions into the story, and only succeeded in delivering some unrealistic but dramatic dialogues.

Besides the main characters, almost all other characters were useless or replaceable in the story of second chapter. Kamal, Rajendra Desai, Virat (and his companion, which isn't clear what happened to him), were wasted, even though they were built character (in Chapter 1) and their deaths could have brought forth lot better drama into the story. Guru Pandian and Andrews were doing something, but not showing properly what they were doing in relations to Rocky and his operations destroyed their impact their betrayals could have impacted the viewer. It was also unclear how much Inayat Khalil was connected with Rocky's operations, for which his angry reaction later on also delivered no feeling at all. The story kept going with numerous things unclear, even about what exactly Adheera was doing while recovering. Hence, the story became entirely unimportant. And be frank, the directors and writers seems to have done it intentionally. They wanted to keep their focus completely on Rocky's charisma and dialogue deliveries. Which, in my view, could have also be done by keeping proper delivery of the story (as the first chapter did.)

Let's come to another issue with the script. Guru Pandian's hidden actions were supposed to deliver a twisting climax surprise. As I said earlier, the unfolding of this twist failed to deliver the shocking impact this should have delivered because we were not showed his connection and attachment to Rocky and his business properly. But it also failed because several of the things happened were entirely unclear. Most importantly the no-confidence motion drama, and then the election of Ramika Sen, like how exactly DYSS later failed and then Ramika Sen then came to power. Also, the drama of that secret passage from which Rocky realized that behind everything there was Guru Pandian. And if we look closely, several of Pandian's actions seemed idiocy. He had staged the attack on Garuda for which Adheera was framed, and informed Adheera of Garuda's attack priorly. Now, why exactly he did that? To take control over KGF? How? When he ignited a war between Garuda and Adheera, it was obvious that one of them would have won. And whoever won would then have control of KGF, not him. Alright, he might have plans to kill the other by other means. But in that case wasn't it better to have let Adheera get killed by Garuda and then kill Garuda by using an assassin (Rocky in this case)? Why save Adheera then by informing him of Garuda's plan of killing him?

Now let's come to the ending. In my eyes this is the worst possible ending the writers should have come up with. Ok, KGF was destroyed. So what? Rocky wanted to become the richest man on earth to fulfill his promise to his dying mother. Technically, he had no attachment to the land of KGF. He was only interested in the gold underneath the lands. And he had already grabbed most or all of it. Now he is on a ship full of that gold. He probably has more gold than most governments in the world. What should be his action now? There are many things he can actually do. He can go to a poor country and make a deal with them, offering some or half of his gold in exchange of his placement in that country's government system. He can also purchase several islands, hire an impressive mercenary army, and live like a King for the rest of his life, and die at the age of 80 as the richest man on earth. But what he does here? He goes directly to Indian Navy, and also tells them he's coming to them, so that they kill him. Why is in so much hurry to die in presence of his gold? Probably he doesn't have confidence on himself that he would be able to keep his gold for the rest of his life. And he doesn't want to die without his gold. Duh!

Only reason I'm even giving this chapter 3 stars instead of 1 is because Rocky's charisma delivered good impact at several places in the movie, which were fun to watch, along with some creative dialogues from him as well as Ramika Sen. But overall it is the biggest opportunity lost in the History of Indian Cinema. This movie surely had the potential of breaking all the records ever. It could have achieved even bigger feats compared to Baahubali Conclusion. Maybe this chapter would still do good business, because Indian's are more diverted towards brainless charisma type movies, rather than realism of the stories. But honestly, anyone who watch the movies and can see through the untold parts of the movie would feel the same frustration I did while watching this chapter."

Without a doubt his performance in emotional scenes, Romantic scens and fighting scens are worth watch .I saw many incredible performance throughout the movie. Narration by Prakash Raj, performance of #RaveenTandon as Politician is superb. But #SanjayDatt as Adheera without a doubt he was terrific. His head to head fight scenes with Yash were terrrfic. Shrinidhi setty with Yash looks very good pair to watch out for. Her performance was good. BGM and action scenes were good. I love all the fighting scenes and Gun shot scenes. But movie was little bit drawn in 1st half. Aside from this it's proper bonanza."

                ","KGF is what we Indians call a perfect ""maas"" movie: jaw-dropping action, amazing cinematography, and terrific screenplay!

All revolving around the protagonist who is nothing sort of a monster!

Sure some might call the action ""logic-defying, "" but its done with such powerful narrative that you don't care about logic. All your focus is on rooting for the protagonist.

And that requires a powerful script, something KGF has."

                ","Watched KGF2 Movie:

*Our friends successfully tolerated the uninterrupted relentless torture together for about 180 minutes (3 hours) and came out without being wounded although our ears were deaf and bodies were in vibration mode*

* @moviesndtv Review:*

KGF2 just like KGF1 is a test for all your senses.


None of us understood the story and direction if there was any



Our *ears* were bombarded with extreme gunshot sounds and screams, even we could hear the sounds in the washroom during the intermission



A continuous flow of sweat, blood, and tears from *eyes and skin* throughout ended up dehydrated



The effect of battle were so intense that we could feel our *body* with IMAX seats were shaking. Do not know may be because of the bad quality of IMAX seats



*100% Sickularism* incorporated movie. Continuously reminded of ""Rahim Chacha Syndrome""



Justified that Rocky (Sultan) and enemy gangs were more violent than Mughals hence, our historians chose to write *Aurangzeb a hero*



Being studied in Kolar and KGF area I am scared to go there now because of *Adheera*



Successfully overtook *RRR and Pushpa* and became No.1 in showing violence. Wait somebody said *Kashmir files* was violent which is only 10% compared to these



Urduwood has invaded Tollywood and Kollywood by taking liberal actors from D gang and translating south movies in Hindi



The blockbuster led South actors and industry rich and famous but lost value



Ohh I remember there was one intimate love song and love story which gave smoothening effect for 3 minutes for all the sense organs



Proved the theory that politicians, filmies, @BJP/Malvika Avinash sell their ideology. Rocky also says that becz of this British's ruled us for 200+ years without mentioning the 800+ years g@nucide



I am visualizing the kind of movies that will be released in future looking at these films garnered 800-100 CR. Of course also from the inspiration of secular live RIOTS in India after a during a H!ndu festival yatra

And waited for this for more than 3 years. It wasn't worth watching.

Its quite overrated movie like many other south indian action drama films where everything is hero and he can do everything.

I ain't saying that every south indian movie is like this. But we can see action and drama at particular limit. But in this movie they've made everything exaggerating. No story. Everyone is over acting. Sanjay dutt has done little good at least not overacting. There isn't single song which we remember after coming out of theatre. Overuse of camera angles....

                ","I am writing this after my second viewing and have to say I loved KGF-2 more the second time. And I already have an urge to watch it one more time very soon. The feeling you get after watching this movie cannot be evoked just by the story, script, bgm, epic scale, spectacle, gorgeous cinematography, humor, actors, or emotional scenes. They all are necessary, but more importantly they also have to blend well. KGF-2 blends them all so well that it lingers around for a long time with you. The impact is so deep that you can't watch any other movie for a few days. And that's what compels you to watch KGF-2 again and again, until you overdo it.

That's my review, that's my way of saying that KGF-2 is not a movie, but an emotion, just like KGF-1.

Some may not connect to KGFs at emotional level. I feel bad for them because then KGFs would look to them like a string of flashy/humorous/emotional scenes in an epic backdrop involving a complex war for the throne and gold. They would find it to be a good movie (based on technical aspects, story, and other parameters), but not a great movie and definitely can't understand those of us who call it an emotion."

                ","There's immense hype for the movie. Some might get disappointed and some might be overwhelmingly happy. Personally, I loved the movie a lot.

There's not much scope for the story, much like the Chapter 1. But the movie does the justice to the action sequences, buildup to the heroes, villains and other characters.

Yash as Rocky bhai nailed it yet again. Other characters were superb too. Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Sreenidhi Shetty, Achyuth Kumar, Prakash Raj and every other character were very good.

However, there are two slightly underwhelming aspects. While the background music was very good, the songs weren't upto the expectations. While the hero faces a lot of challenges, it also becomes pretty obvious through the motion of the movie that the hero would be nearly unbeatable. The movie still surprises the audience with its unexpected twists.

Overall, it's a very good movie. My suggestion would be not to have any expectations. It's indeed above expectations due to the scale and action.

And, one shouldn't definitely miss the post-credits scene."

It's a very difficult movie to make and they have made it well.

The cinematography is top notch ; this man will go places

Yash lights up the screen ; his dialogues feel out of place every now and then-it dilutes the intensity especially his Intro scene :( but his swag and style make up for whatever rubbish lines he says sometimes)

Srinidhi Shetty deserved much meatier role for her commitment to the movie

Sanjay Dutt screams a bit more than necessary

Raveena Tandon is a find and she nails it

Greatest loss in the movie- Anant nag is sorely missed - whatever reason may be, Prakash Rai's substitution does not do justice to the movie: ANANT Ingalagi's narration lifted the movie; you can't help but imagine Anant nag in place of Prakash Rai every time he narrates and end up feeling disappointed .

Malavika gets monotonous and repetitive after sometime .

Towards the end I stopped rooting for the mother- I felt she was eventually responsible for her son becoming a criminal - to become rich at every expense

Having said so many negatives, still I vouch for the entire team's commitment to Make such a brave attempt; you need a large heart to do such a movie- I saw and felt similar efforts in Avane Srimannarayana and am glad this movie is doing well - Happy days for kannada cinema

Please watch the movie inspite of all its flaws ( I am nit picking like a purist ); I enjoyed it but could not find a character I wanted to root for like KGF chapter 1."

Choppy action scenes. I can't think of a single thing that I liked about it.

Raveena shines as a tigress and pounds heavily. Sanjay Dutt plays his role well.

Yash steals the show with his charisma and he is the REAL GOLD. His confidence and dialogue delivery is clap worthy.

                ","Hailing from Bangalore, I always wondered why Kannada movies with a rich heritage never struck gold at the Indian box office. It was far more subdued than other South Indian film industries. KGF 1 and now KGF 2 have changed all that. It is therefore a matter of immense pride for me personally to see Kannada movies doing so well.

I watched the movie at the global premiere in UAE ... the 1150pm show, even though the next day was a working day. But, not once did I regret going to a movie at such an inappropriate time. The movie was all I expected and much more. It had a great storyline that remained true to the central theme of Rocky having a motive. Every action emanates from that and which is exactly why you constantly empathize with his character, even though his villainy was obnoxious at times. That is the strength of the writing, as you viewed the character just like the way the director aspired. This for me was the biggest strength of the movie.

The movie continues from where KGF1 left. All the aspirers to throne of Narachi are stunned into silence when Rocky replaces Garuda at the helm of affairs. So, to get him down, they connect with Adhira, the uncle of Garuda. The fight then is between Adhira and Rocky. You see many points where it looks like Rocky is going down to Adhira but he always has a plan up his sleeve. The culmination of that fight forms the crux of the movie.

Prashant Neel has done an amazing job with his writing and direction. Every frame looks like a masterpiece and the dark muted tones makes the movie a visual delight. Some of the frames are simply out of this world. The casting is picture perfect including Adhira, Ramika and others. It seems they selected themselves for this role. I would recommend this movie to every cinema lover.

The climax is a killer and after the Kattappa Bahubali saga, this is indeed a break point to cherish. I hope the makers of KGF have a plan up their sleeve."

                ",This movie is edited better than its predecessor. The action set pieces are explosive in a way we rarely seen in indian cinema. Cinematography is beautiful. However none of that can overcome the fact that i had no emotional connection with the hero and his motivation. But i already expected that because of chapter 1 so it didn't bother me as much.

                ","One of the marvelous movies of 2022 till now.

Pros: Screenplay is fabulous, no doubt it will keep you hooked to the movie. Everybody has performed well. Especially Ravina, I bet you will get goosebumps during her entry. Grand entry of hero/villian Yash is superb will make you blow whistles. You can connect with each and every character in the movie including extras, you can feel pain/fear in their face. It is a mixture of emotions and action. Treat for action lovers. Casting is good.

Cons: Background music is good, but sometimes you feel BGM is overpowering dialogue especially in first half. Some of the fights could have been avoided. They could used Sanjay's presence a lil more. Couldn't feel chemistry between Reena and Rocky.

Overall KGF 2 is worth watching and of course there is a surprise at the end!"

                ","This movie will make you feel emotions that you have never felt in your entire life, once out of the movie theatre you will be left with no words to even describe the larger-than-life experience you just had. The fast and crisp storytelling and an onslaught of Mind-blowing dialogues will blow your mind away.

Chapter 2 is totally surreal and unbelievably magnificent in its entirety. The cinematography of this film is something that will be talked about for years and act as a reference for the upcoming generation of aspiring filmmakers. The BGM is very energetic and will keep you hooked to the screen for the entire time

The core emotion of the film which is the bond between the MOTHER and SON is beautifully blended with the action-packed storyline and it never feels out of place or unnecessary and has a great impact on the decisions taken by the main character ROCKY.

The first half of the film focuses on Rocky and the developments he witnessed in his life after the conclusion of chapter 1 and the relationship that he builds with the people of KGF. The song 'TOOFAN' will surely give you goosebumps and it also very smartly retells the events which unfold in the FIRST Chapter.

The second half is full of twists and turns and will keep you on the edge of your seats.

AND the CLIMAX of this film is VISUALLY STUNNING and of PEAK PERFECTION.

The entire cast including YASH, SANJAY DUTT, SRINIDHI SHETTY, and others did a fabulous job and gave full justice to their characters but among them all, RAVEENA TANDON with limited screentime gave her career-best performance and stood out in the character of RAMIKA SEN. She was an equal match for ROCKY as the villain.

DON'T THINK TOO MUCH

Just go and watch this MASTERPIECE

IT IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY."

I am running out of the words to describe the movie.

Expectations were high because of KGF-1, But Yash , Sanjay Dutt, and one and only Prashant Neel given one of the best movie of modern cinema.

Built of story was mindblowing............. BGM ,Music were extraordinary and the feeling in theatre was unimaginable.

Story was little bit lagging but doesn't matter.

Characters of Rocky and Adhira are larger than life......... which is my favourite part......"

                ","Finally decided to watch the second part after all the hype even after finding first part to be just average. Thought the director might have actually improved but ohh no i was so wrong it's worse now.

The movie starts with the entry of our Rocking Star Yash with a BGM and they Forgotted to off that BGM throught the film. BGM plays on throughout the whole movie yeah it's good but after one points it's just unbearable and can cause headache even during normal talking scenes there is a BGM. Then the film proceeds to have 20 more entry scenes of Yash till the end of the movie. Everyone comes praises Rocky then disappear oh gosh. The second half bores you in place of being entertaining specially during romantic scenes which you seriously don't care about. The romance seems very forced just to make Rocky Bhai furious enough to kill Adheera.

The action sequences are just as poorly edited as the first part the most awkward is the car chase scene where it continuously blacks out for no reason dude show it clearly it's a action movie after all. The action in other parts is also medicore and again fast paced with many cuts. The supporting actors are there just for the sake of it. Sanjay Dutt is wasted with very minimum screen time and no character depth at all you know already he would get defeated by Rocky Bhai easily. Raveena is decent in her role but again not much importance given to her . Plus the movie is filled with many absurd scenes which don't make any sense.

Overall the second part is even worse than first and only cinematography can't save a bad film infact i founded the first part to have better colours and better frames than this. How are people calling this mess a masterpiece is beyond my understanding. It's just too much to take. Chapter 3 is also coming which I'm not even tiny bit interested about after this movie's experience."

                ","Chapter II lost the soul and human element chapter I had. This may have happened because there are big producers like Excel media is involved in producing the film.

Chapter I had a very strong character built for Rocky Bhai. In this chapter, chapter II, Rocky Bhai is shown weak. Chapter I, Rocky Bhai thinks multiple steps ahead of his nemesis. Chapter II he is shown reacting to the events which makes him weak."

                ","Art is for the Humans, by the Humans Period!

Not watching this mighty film on big screen is equivalent to seeing Monalisa in real life. She's only an art if she's on canvas. If not, she just a normal looking human being like everyone.

Similarly this brutally crude, appealingly exhilarating, superabundant entertainer can only be savored on Big Screen.

Cinema is where the 24 commanding art forms come together into an invincibly aggregated energy and we as Humans are bound to behold the beauty: The KGF Chapter 2.

We can't teach a monkey to ponder & dissect the facets of a multilayered piece of art even if we dedicate our whole lives in training it. Of all things bestowed on the so-called ""supremely heavenly entities"" Human Beings, the ability to cognize, analyze & comprehend an art form is the apex of all. Imbibing art, appreciating the art form glorifies the Human existence and maintains the balance between sanity & insanity of Life.

KGF Chapter 2 is barely an integral chapter in the history of Indian Cinema. It's a frickin' textbook on commercial condiments of art-imbuing Cinema. It's something bigger than you, me, and us and above us.

It's the redemption of endangering big screen phenomenon called CINEMA. This is CINEMA. It's inspiring, loud, taut, larger-than-life, rooted, astonishing, wild, inspiring & joyous.

I am completely steeped in the notion that the maker Prashant Neel who throttled this carnival is an alien and until he himself persuades me into believing he's not I am going to firmly stick to that assertion.

If you are a human and resist watching films like this you are not worth being a HUMAN. I'm sorry! But this is how it is. Cinema is not just an entertainer. CINEMA is art. Cinema is giving Life. Cinema is eternal, Cinema is responsibility, and Cinema is an experience with no replacement.

Cinema is larger than life. Beyond! Period. If you say otherwise fight & win me (that's impossible) This is not a review. It's a thank you note to the Cinema makers, of the cinema KGF, & by the Cinema admirer.

                ","3 of the actions stunts was better. First half is slow as well as the second half. The film will go beyond because of its fan base. They will definitly love it but as an average audience will find it poorly written and poorly choreographed action scene. There should be more twist and turns but u will rarely find any twist and turns and lacks of story. Seems like they were trapped into a tilt storyline. Swag and heroism was top notch and bgm was superb. One time watchable movies and at any point it cant beat baahubali and rrr in ant way however mass audience will love it as yash made a big fan base.

Money matters most. They knows it very wll. Thats y Chapter 3 will come outta nowhere. The tea boy finds the Chapter 3 books at the end. Wait for the post credit scene."

                ","What worked: One of the challenges while making the movie to make the viewers relate and convince them that the story is engaging. This movie is a winner for that matter. The movie is bigger, better and interesting, and even more engaging that the first chapter. The lead characters are commendable in their role. Sanjay Dhatt and Raveena were well introduced in their roles, added the needed spice and interest in the movie. It's amazing that a movie with this budget could hold the scale and execution in such a believable and engaging story. The narrative is well written , characters well acted, well edited, scored, mixed and produced. The movie with the budget could pull a production and execution makes a case study for the film makers as to how to execute and narrate the story. And for that matter director deserves the praise for keeping all the departments well balanced in their respective roles as a film makers. I am sure the film makers across are watching the movie with an awe and an opportunity to research how to make a movie with the scale, execution, acting and overall making of the movie. We have been hearing about a young and bright editor of the movie . I am sure everyone has an eye on him after this movie. The movie excites and eagers us for the next chapter of the great combo of Yash and Prashant's next venture, and we can say the movie is a benchmark and path breaker for the Indian movie industry to learn what can be achieved with the right vision and execution as the movie has rare dull moments but lots of punchlines and treats that keeps the jaws dropping for most parts of the movie What did not work: Very few scenes come to my head as what can and needs to be changed in this movie, making it better than the first chapter. Maybe the love song could have been shortened like other songs but hey who am I to say since the movie works overall for the most part which is quiet rare. So, even with plot holes, if any, movie works big time for the viewers to enjoy the ride.

Final verdict: highly recommended."

                ","My ears are still ringing after sitting through 168 minutes of extremely loud & jarring background score. But I must admit the sequel to the ultra-stylish KGF is far better than its predecessor. And we all how bad sequels usually turn out to be. To be honest, I didn't like the first movie even one bit. But Chapter 2, I didn't mind sitting through.

Chapter 2 picks up right after the events of Chapter 1. Rocky is now the undisputed king of KGF. But this position comes with its share of enemies and that include the Viking inspired, Adheera (Sanjay Dutt); Prime Minister, Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) among others.

KGF has its downsides. First and foremost is the jarring BGM, which literally numbs you for a while post-movie. Then comes the poor shooting skills: despite all the arms training, Rocky's men cannot hit a target. Adheera is standing front and centre; all his men get shot but Adheera gets shot once on his shoulder (a beautifully shot scene nevertheless). Rocky also sets up the biggest fan for his lady love - using helicopter blades.

But Chapter 2 is better in terms of its pacing. After all the setup done in the first, the sequel makes more sense. The stakes are higher, the action set pieces are more extravagant. The 19-year old editor, Ujwal Kulkarni does a very good job. Rocking Star, Yash is as flamboyant as ever. Raveena R Tandon & Sanjay Dutt are good. Prakash Raj replaces Anant Nag as the narrator (maybe they wanted a bigger star in this role). Female lead Srinidhi Shetty doesn't have much to do & her Stockholm Syndrome track doesn't bode too well.

Chapter 2 may cause irreversible damage to your ear drums but it is definitely a step up from the first. The final sequence on the ship seemed a bit anticlimactic and the announcement of Chapter 3 was totally unnecessary (better if they end on a high) but go for it if you love mass-y films. Rocking Star Yash's 8 years of hardwork and beard maintenance has paid off.

P. S. Find a theatre that is running the Kannada (original version) with Subtitles. Watching it in another language won't give you the full experience."

                ","I was thinking that I would rate this movie 10/10 but after watching it, I was disappointed by the story. In my view, KGF Chapter 2 could not meet my expectations which was set high by KGF Chapter 1.

The Chapter 1 was filled with too much stories compacted in short period of time. It had got war, power, politics, diplomacy, emotions and everything else to make a movie great. But the Chapter 2 is unable to include everything in a balanced way. No doubt that there are great fight scenes with some rare cinematography ever witnessed in indian cinema. But story wise, it is too weak.

The character development isn't also in par with KGF Chapter 1. The portrayal of villainous characters are so weak that they only seem strong in their getup and armor. There is no diplomatic play between the characters. Sanjay Dutt as Adheera looks dangerous but the movie portrayed him in a weak way. There's no mind game. They just fight and and the only stronger wins. Other villains like Rajendar Desai, Shetty and Andrew who were portrayed great in Chapter 1 died of nothing. Also Adheera isn't someone who was shown to be like a diplomatic and strong character. Disappointed.

This movie is great if you are a fan of Yash and someone who likes fights, guns, slow motions, styles and cinematography. But other than that everything seems forced inside a movie to grab the attention of the audience (which failed in my case). The movie could have been great and better that Chapter 1.

Maybe the writer was unable to discern what made people like KGF Chapter 1. I will not go the theatre to watch the Chapter 3 with such weak story."

                ","Before anything i want to share about a guy sitting right beside me in the theatre. He was pissed with all the hooting in beginning of the movie saying ""I can't listen anything"". 1 hour into the movie i noticed him also shouting clapping and cheering. This was the Charisma of Yash (The Rocky Bhai).

The entry scene of each character, BGM, acting everything surpassed all the level. A pure mass cinema and a treat to watch."

                ",It's high time the audience have scene heroes doing wonders in South movies. Yet the raw style of Yash and dialogs are treat to watch.. Only annoying thing is the excessive slow motion scenes and again no logic movie made in 2 parts. The main character (Rocky) does every thing only to fulfill his mother's wish. Then dies in the end with all gold. Common guys you could have done better than that.

                ","KGF Chapter II will remain one of the most technically sound films made in India. Be it the expansive set design or the brilliant camerawork or even those lavish suits that Rocky wears, or the makeup on Adheera, KGF's technical department deserves all praise for making a grand contribution to this magnum opus BUT it is the story and overdose of machismo that makes a dent in the experience and leaves an average aftertaste. It might have the so-called spices that makes up a summer blockbuster but the screenplay is quite immaterial, hardly written with thought and care, and even to a point predictable. And Raveena Tandon does the finest in the acting department while the others only scream and yell - if only that could be called acting?! Yash does fine in getting the commanding presence required of his messiah plus gangster plus monster image in Rocky but his style and panache does get in the way of actual emoting. Also dubbing in Hindi could have been better."

                ","This movie's a treat to mass fans, which has got everything, elevations, reverberating BGM, extraordinary cinematography and novel editing.

The only worry was the inconsistent screenplay, which didn't remain smooth throughout the movie, especially the love track.

Yash's swag and screen presence was on another level, Sanjay Dutt looked menacing and Raveena Tandon has got a meaty role, rest were good.

Not an easy task to pull off such spectacle, especially after the first part's success, but Prashanth Neel and team did it with flying colours."

                ","Personally, I enjoyed chapter 1 more than this chapter, because of the suspense they created and the planning to kill garuda and the way the hero kills garuda alone. That's just entirely on a different level. Admiral was also a good villain but the fight was normal as we expect from south Indian cinema.

No hate! Just my review."

                ","One of the better sequel or chapter 2 after Drishyam.

Toughest part for any director is continuing a same story in second chapter. When expectations are high they need to deliver a movie with strong story lineup... KGF2 has almost succeeded and gave a perfect sequel. I watched KGF1... for the first half i got bored but story opened up after 2nd half but in KGF2 story took pace in first half but lagged in second half. Overall a good movie... a hero oriented mass movie. I like the way of narration & story connecting to the sequence. Prashant Neel has a unique way of story telling hatsoff to his direction and Yash acting is fabulous, he carries an attitude look n style throughout the movie. Cinematography is awesome BGM looks overloaded sometimes it overlaps & irritating but editing was really bad compared to KGF1 fight & chasing scenes were worstly edited. All characters in the movie were up to the mark but Sanjay Dutt was literally unwanted to this movie Adheera character could have been done by some other actors from south who is famous for villain character like Jagapathi Babu or any other actor. Sanjay Dutt couldn't connect to the story, just his looks n style were good as a villain.

Go without any expectation... you will definitely like the movie.

Don't miss the twist in the end & initial narration of Prakash Raj its interconnected. Thank you 😊"

Not a great story , unnecessary elevations , unnecessary charectors , over the top fights .

The whole point of hero doing all this is not convincing .

Director forgot about ethics and common sense . Hero simply fires guns without any need just to waste time in movie .

Villian always leaves hero just to extend movie further . And vice-versa

Like any true movie buff, I wait till the end of end credits, there only you get to see if there's any future to the project.

If you don't wait till the end of the credits, then chapter 2 would seem like a haphazard conclusion to chapter 1!!

There you loose your enthusiasm, but boy this movie is a rockstar film! Yash is spell bounding and the remaining cast put on a good show, and yes they could have improved more but then again to err is human!!

                ","It's rare for a sequel to outperform the first part in movies but that has come true for KGF. Chapter 2 was comparatively better than chapter 1. Amazing script, Amazing performance by all actors and excellent cinematography and sound mix . Big thumps up to the team KGF."

                ",It got lost due to expectations from the first instalment and spent more time on epic ness rather than making the screenplay engaging..the bgm is jarring at times and too many jumpcuts making the viewing experience confusing. The story doesn't justify itself neither logically nor emotionally. Its a one time watch for good cinematography.

Rocky played by Yash is the definition of larger than life mass character. Prashant Neel and his whole team's hardwork is seen in each frame. I don't think there'll ever be such a movie in our kannada industry anytime soon unless there's part 3, i hope I'm proven wrong.

On top of it stroy might look very simpler but the craft really is in making that simple story more engaging which this team has done exceptionaly well. I can't point any negatives at all, this is pure escapism movie which i recommend you to watch with free mind."

                ","KGF2 - One should accept that if there could be a movie which can have a mass opening in par with a Bahubali, a RRR and many other it can only be KGF2. Flabbergasted by the kind of reception this movie had from the very beginning title card . It was indeed Larger than life. It took me 3.5 years to watch KGF 1 and that was a huge miss but this time I ensured not to make the same mistake and I did KGF2 in about 48hrs of release and I feel superbly happy . I repeat , the directors vision, control on the story and the screenplay, everything was at its best . Ravi Basrur, never heard before KGF and can never forget post either, brilliant music may it be songs or BGM. His contribution brought in so much life to the movie . Bhuvan Gowdaf for excellent cinematography, it was a different and amazing world altogether. And there was this whole load of actors including Sanjay Dutt, Raveena , Prakashraj, Srinidhi , Easwari Rao weaving this wonderful movie with a solid needle called Yash . Undoubtedly he pulls out his life's finest performance here and without missing even a inch he perfectly fits to the character . He's Super Smart and Sema Fit . I bet , none but him could have done this role any better . Salam Rocky Bhai. This is not just a movie but an experience. Loved every bit of it . Huge respect to director Prashanth Neel , words can't just say the kind of work he has put in . Class apart . I would say, The real BEAST of this season is ROCKY. Overall KGF, King of Great Films.

Note : Dont miss the scenes post credits at end of movie."

Being Kannadiga, I'm proud to say this is what kannada film industry is capable of.

Unfortunately this is was long over due, lot of actors and actress from Karnataka have been leading faces of other cinema industry but with this movie it gives me a hope that Sandalwood doesn't loose anymore talented artists.

As much as I appreciate the movie being a kannada movie, I'd like to think this is an Indian movie and expect to see many more splendid movies."

                ","KGF chapter 2 is final chapter of KGF saga. KGF both movies are no doubt best action movies in indian cinema with list of bahubali and RRR, but Prashant neel need to learn from rajamauli on how to conclude a movie. It appears Director is under a lot of pressure of expectation. A story must make it forward naturally but here it has forced to reach a end and to cover all character. Although this movie has already made a history. I have analysed this movie on different aspects.

1. Story: Chapter 2 is full of loopholes and forced narration. Although this story has a connection to common man but it not truely explain why a mother want his son to become most powerful man on earth but not tell any ethics ?..He just want to be powerful with no ethics and he is hero of the movie.

2. Direction: Very confused and reaching nowhere till end occur in a forced way. Many scenes are appeared without logic and this shows director is very confused with respect to expectation from first part.(7/10)

3. Acting: All actors have done justice to their roles but this film does not provide character justification and importance, such as Adheera. Director should give more depth to these characters but he misses.(7/10)

4. Action: Full on best part of movie(10/10).

5. Music & Background score: Songs are average and not good. Basrur disappoint this time. Songs from first part are better.(5/10)

Although background score is good. (9/10)

6. Editing: Could be more better and it is not smooth as chapter 1. (6/10)

Hence overall rating is 7/10 and chapter 2 is disappoinment w.r.t first chapter. Still it is shining star of kanada and indian film industry."

Although the editing during the action sequences is very disturbing and annoying as well. And I still couldn't connect myself with the romantic angle of this movie similar to that of the Chapter-1.

But yeah, in the end it's all about the celebration of the aura of the big man, Rocky Bhai (Yash) and that's exactly where the makers did hit the ball out of the park.

Kudos to the entire team for their hardwork and dedication to this mammoth project which is finally paying off."

Sanjay Dutt is electrifying as hard-hearted Adheera in KGF2. His menacing getup is a big plus... Raveena Tandon is top notch. Wonderful to see her talent being respected and utilised in a meaty role... SrinidhiShetty gets enough screen time and scope to hold her own.

Prashanth Neel is a terrific storyteller. He smartly uses every tool at his disposal - remarkable background score, brilliantly executed action pieces and clap-trap moments - to transport you to the world of KGF2... The stunning visuals only enhance his vision.

KGF Chapter2 is the Best Pan India movie from South so far.. Technically untouchable..

Agree with Yash..If u will provide Prashanth right budget he will make World class movie.. Salaam Rocky Bhai ."

                ",I loved John Wick specially because everyone in the world fear him like death. Put that fear and increase the rowdiness to ten folds and you have your Rocky Bhai. This movie will be one of my all time favorite movie because it has madness like Madmax and it has swag like John Wick and it has pace like Fast and furious. You don't get time to relax or breath as you will miss on some exhibition of this action packed joyride. What a class movie with hints of GOT and everything else we love in cinemas. One of the best Indian movie ever made in action genre. Full marks for action and direction.

One true thing is that, after PUSHPA, and RRR Movies are in a different league and KGF chapter 2 doesn't even revolve around the same standards. And definitely this movie is definitely overrated for no reason."

                ","K. G. F: Chapter 2 was directed by Prashanth Neel and stars once again Yash as Rocky Bhai, the new kingpin of Kolar Gold Fields (also known as K. G. F.). Srinidhi Shetty, Archana Jois, Malavika Avinash, Ayyappa P. Sharma, Harish Rai and Dinesh Mangaluru reprise their roles from the first chapter, while Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon, Saran Sakthi, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj are the new cast members in this sequel. Chapter 2 is definitely a step-up, compared to the last installment. It's bigger and better, and the production value and action sequences have vastly improved. K. G. F: Chapter 2 is, without a doubt, a commercial film, but the difference between this movie and other Indian commercial films is that the movie relies heavily on the script. The film is 2 hours and 48 minutes long, and it doesn't waste any single frame during the entire runtime. There isn't one unnecessary scene that feels it doesn't belong in the script. Kudos to the producer, Vijay Kiragandur for understanding and sharing Prashanth Neal's vision, for appreciating this bold script and for letting Neel execute the film exactly how he wanted.

Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is probably the best one I've seen in the past few years, when it comes to Indian cinema. It's evident that the crew has invested a lot in production values and set designs by just looking at the cinematography and see how detailed every frame is implemented. Every single frame is jaw-dropping and astoundingly gorgeous, and the visual effects are undoubtedly on point. Ujwal Kulkarni also deserves to be praised for editing the film as smoothly as possible and for keeping the movie thrilling and engaging from start to end. The amazing score and soundtrack by Ravi Basrur elevates the movie to a whole another level. It captures the emotions the characters go through, creates tension and increases the excitement level beautifully. The action sequences handled by Anbariv are astonishing and beyond what you could've ever imagined. It's also worth to mention that the action sequences rely heavily on practical effects, and the fact that they are in the same range as Hollywood films, such as Fast & Furious, Die Hard and Mad Max: Fury Road is refreshing to watch.

All the cast members have delivered powerhouse performances. Yash proves once again that he is the man of the show. His dialogue delivery and the way he perform the fight choreography are magnificent. Like I mentioned in my previous reviews, it's very important that the antagonist is equally as strong as the protagonist both mentally and physically to keep the film engaging. The way Prashanth Neel has structured and developed the character Adheera is excellent. Sanjay Dutt was absolutely the perfect choice for this role, and he knocked it out of the park with style. Raveena Tandon, Eswari Rao and Prakash Raj were also brilliant in their respective roles as Prime Minister Ramika Sen, Farman's mother and Vijayendra Ingalagi. Archana Jois, who portrayed Rocky's mother, Shanthamma, may have very little screen time compared to the rest of the cast, but she has surely delivered a phenomenal performance. Srinidhi Shetty, who portrayed Rocky's love interest, Reena Desai, definitely has a lot more to do in this film, compared to Chapter 1, and she has also delivered a neat performance.

Overall, K. G. F: Chapter 2 can easily be considered as one of the best action films India has ever produced, mainly for its technical finesse, strong dialogues, exceptional cinematography and brilliant performances. Don't miss it in the theaters."

                ","What a movie!! Feast to eyes! Bgm and cinematography was better than part 1. Movie was finished in 90 crores but RRR budget was 500 crore! I watched both movies, trust me movie setup is very grand and realistic in KGF 2. I don't blame RRR, their setup were great, but in budget Of 90cr this movie is a gem!

There is no much chemistry shown between male and female lead roles, but I assume that was the aim of the movie, it was more of gangster movie than romantic entertainer!

Coming to dialogues! This was best I enjoyed, every dialogue was written carefully, and well executed!

Negative role by Sanju Baba, he did his best! The cruelty was well portrayed!

The action sequences are good and worth watching! All variants of action sequences are shot, martial, lethal weapons, car stunts and fights, traditional weapons and etc! So the full efforts were put on action sequences!

My hearty congrats to the KGF2 making team, they made a paisa wasool movie!"

As I literally love action type of films this is my favourite and part 1 also. Songs of the film are so lovely you can feel the emotions and you even get goosebumps while watching from starting to end of the film. You can't even look down your eyes from the screen even for a second. Dialogues are really dangerous though. In the end words can't explain how much people love this film."

                ","Story: Story continues from KGF chapter 1 right where it ended. The plot is very clean and perfectly executed. But, a small part is misconnecting chapter 1 and 2. (Not mentioned due to spoiler) Music: There is nothing new about the music. As usual, it is extraordinary. Best viewed in Dolby atmos.

Screenplay& Direction: Even though there are many violent scenes and some unrealistic scenes, they contain a good emotion in them.

Probably this would be one of the best movies of the decade. This review is not based on heroic elevations. A story is said to be well executed only when we feel the complete essence in it. KGF series did it in a marvelous way. The movie hasn't been dramatized too much like other high budget commercial movies but it contained a deep felt emotion."

                ","Plus: Showing actual (negative roles) of Andrews,Rajendra desai and Kamal was really a good story for beginning of KGF2.

Vanaram's continuation looked good too. He doesnt show any aggression even in chapter1 and is wise character was really good and perfectly suited .

Confusion cleared how Adheera is alive and it was as interesting as possible.

Dubai scene of Inayath and Rocky was intelligent from director . And also getting new weapons from him too . Perfectly synced scene these all are without any deviation in story. Dialogue scene when Rocky kills adheera henchmen and revealing of the weapons was really brilliant like a revenge.

Director displayed a creative side of Rocky too. The way he changed KGF infrastructure was shown at a perfect timing.

Screenplay and bgm syncing was unique and exciting during car chase scene when Reena was captured.

Twists of the movie are really unique. Happy to see modern age movies getting modern twists. Also corrupt politicians scene in front of PM was good beginning of rivalry.

A Unique location for a climax too. Also concluded kgf birth is rocky's birth . As well as kgf's end is rocky's end.

Every suspense characters from chapter 1 was logically continued in chapter 2.

Minus: Few scenes looked like old movie scenes like herione getting captured, Hero spending his life not as a citizen of country because a promise, Because of a promise of a kid ,U cannot live selfishly.

Rocky and Adheera's fight too looked bit routine. Chapter 1's last fight was masterpiece actually. Looked like adheera's character ended bit hurry without any planning attacks.

'INSPIRATION of Rocky' scenes deserve more hype than people 'SCARED of Adheera'. Few one man army Adheera scenes could have been better but director cared on duration so fine. Only one piece of location were Rocky's army and Adheera's fight so even that looked bit dissappointing as he could cover other locations of Modern KGF infrastructure."

                ","This is one of the best or I say the best pan India movie in true sense. The universe which we seen is impeccable. Director Neel vision is extraordinary.

In today time the script is the only hero. Hail down to writers. Cinematography , performances is top notch And last THE BGM is unbelievable. Must watch Cult classic. This one creates history in Indian cinema,shatters all records."

                ","Don't go with expectations of KGF1, may be hardcore fans rate it 10, but as per me it's 7 People's reaction in this movie is unnatural, that you can feel, in first half you will feel bored for some part. A love song will come that's also not good, lot of apeasment to some communities I hated the sound effects and visual effects in some part Heroism is good, his crazy ideas are good,punch dialogues awesome ,mother sentiment is ok ok, fights ok ok."

Action and direction is good but movies doesn't deserve 8+ imdb rating.

So pls watch with low expectation and lot of illogical action scenes.

But as a person who would say the first part was amazing. This movie plays on that hype but delivers a bit less.

There's too much going on, story is good, but full with small hotch potches.

This is worth a watch but just for the sake of knowing what will happen further with respect to KGF 1.

There are some good and promising action sequences and some are just there for the sake of it. Also too much slo mo hampers the experience a bit. Overall good movie, one time watch."

Without it, it story lineup was amazing even no one can thought this upcoming story lineup when watching the movie.overall its a excellent movie with creating history.i think also this movie has separate fan base. Right through K. G. F: Chapter 2, I couldn't help but imagine what it must have been like for Prashant Neel to watch The Godfather for the first time. More than the whole film, I'd love to ask him someday about the impact its climax left him with as he watched it in what I imagine to be an old theatre, wherever he grew up. Like the iconic theatre scene in Cinema Paradiso, this moment must have been Prashanth's big life-altering moment, his metamorphosis where he not only discovered the magic of movies but also the concept of ""mass"" before it became a thing. Without sounding too dramatic, something must have clicked in him because there's no one here who thinks in intercuts like this man."

                ","When KGF Chapter 1 was released nobody knew that the movie was going to be an action packed roller-coaster ride. So after watching the first chapter everybody was super hyped about the second chapter and it didn't disappoint at all. It was worth every penny we spent on the ticket. Just like chapter 1 the movie is an action packed blockbuster. The Bgm, the editing,and of course the acting was at the top. The movie gave goosebumps almost every time and the dialogues were also perfect. If you like action movies or if you are the fan of the first film this film won't disappoint you at all. The visuals were also very beautiful and the director Prashant Neel did a great job by giving us one of the best action movie of all time from India. The Rocking Star Yash was just amazing as Rocky Bhai and Sanjay Dutt was the perfect villain as Adheera and almost every actor did a great job in making the movie this good. Don't miss this movie and please try and watch it in the theater."

                ","Mind blowing movie for everything- action, direction, story etc.

But only one thing for which I have rated 1 point less is that the heroine was already in love with rocky in chapter 1, but in chapter 2, they are shown as if they don't even know each other. There was no attraction between them in the beginning and the love feeling generated during the coursw of the movie. This was quite surprising for me.

Otherwise movie was awesome."

                ","K. G. F : Chapter 2 review : Stunning Action Packed Drama.

My rating : 5/5 Performances : Yash is just outstanding with his terrific performance and unleashes his amazing screen presence throughout the movie. Yash continued from where he left in KGF 1. He carried himself with the same intensity and energy. He looked stylish, raw, and rugged and costumes suited his swag and mannerisms. He showed variations in his expressions turning brutal, ruthless, and menacing at one time and humane, and emotional at other times.

Srinidhi Shetty got a limited screen presence just like her role in the first part. However, she did full justice to her emoting well.

Sanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Though the scenes featuring Yash and Sanjay Dutt are powerfully written, Sanjay Dutt's age showed up on the screen bringing down the intensity levels.

Raveena Tandon looked intense as a powerful politician who meant business while dealing with the anti-social elements.

Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer performed well and Prakash Raj did justice to her role.

Technical values : Prashant Neel drove everyone crazy with the hero elevation with mass elements in KGF1 which turned him into a national celebrity. All eyes are on him as to how he will come up in the KGF2. Prashant Neel dispelled all the doubts right from the start to the finish. He filled the entire film with heavy-duty action scenes which knocked the living daylights out of the viewers. The standout stunts included Yash's introduction, the action sequence before the interval and scenes that come up after the interval, and the heavy-duty climax. The stunt choreography is sensational. In order to elevate the heroism of Yash, he even showed Sanjay Dutt in an even more powerful manner. The way he ends the character of Rocky is also impressive. KGF 2 has so many factors that will relate to the masses as Neel takes us to the world of KGF and entertains you completely.

Music by Ravi Basrur is a backbone for the film as the re-recording breathes life to the film and all the elevation scenes on Rocky. Audio-wise, the film has all situational songs and is passable on screen.

Bhuvan Gowda's cinematography is top-notch as he presented the film superbly with his framing. The lighting setup created to showcase the dark shades in the movie is impressive.

Anbariv action choreography is Marvelous.

Dialogues are intense and production values are grand.

Highlights : Yash Excellent performance Elevations of Heroism Terrific Action Stunts Cinematography and Bgm Rich production values

Overall : Terrific Monster.

                ","The much awaited sequel of KGF-1 is absolutely worth the wait (of 2 long years). The plot, flow, sequence, cinematography, action and everything was on point and subtle to the core. Rocky's role couldn't have been played by any other actor. He's the man who's made for it - The One and Only Masterpiece❤🔥! The eternal bond between Rocky and Reena, their purest form of love and her audacity are mind-boggling and heartwarming. His mother's name was finally revealed in this chapter. Her puissant relation with Rocky, her words had an immense effect on his life, right from the beginning. In fact, it was truly she who kept him going and combat all his ferocious and heinous combatants who had constantly been backstabbing him. The new roles introduced in this chapter have a big say and the climax made me speechless. But I'm glad about the closing theme giving us a surprise too. The hype created is absolutely worth it! Overall, it is certainly the #PrideOfKarnataka in every way. A fantastic present to the film industry by our Sandalwood. Prashant Neel sir has aced it✨💥! #ProudKannadathi & #ProudFanGirlOFYash❤💥"

                ","After so much hype around the movie, I had watched it in a full packed theatre with great sound system and found myself closing my ears for the loud unnecessary background score. The movie had black out cuts during a car chase sequence and I was surprised, didn't understand a thing that why on earth anyone will edit a car chase in that manner lost my patience there. Throughout the movie I saw only elevations about the protagonist, people come praise him and leave one scene after other. I had a lot of expectation from the movie I really wanted this to be a well written one. But the story lacks emotions I felt no connection towards any character in the movie. The cinematographer had only close shots he didn't capture things well. The camera movements will cause eye ache during Adheera and Rocky fight one on one right after Reena's death. I can go on and on and on with the flaws in the movie but I am wondering how people have become blinded and support this kind of a movie which didn't have any field excelled at any level. Apart from Ananth Nag in the whole of KGF franchise I have not seen a single actor perform well. Yash was all about walking, throwing punch dialogues, I didn't see him act at all. He had a straight face. The villain was weak and for god sake the costume that rocky wears during his meet with prime minister of India is the costume of Allu Arjun in ala vaikuntapuramulo. Atleast they could have changed the Color. It's totally overrated and doesn't deserve what it is enjoying now. Hope Prashanth Neel will atleast give a good movie in his next."

                ","""Hindi viewers, please don't regret later on when it'll be playing on TV and internet."" This is what I mentioned in my review of KGF Chapter 1 after I watched it in cinemas. And today, as I witnessed the second chapter of this epic action saga in cinemas as well, I found myself blown away by the gripping plot, gorgeous visuals, stunning action sequences and most importantly, Yash's screen presence as Rocky. I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.

KGF Chapter 2 expands the scale and story introduced to us in part 1 and ends up raising the bar higher. The makers were definitely quite confident making it, and it shows in every single frame. From beautifully picturizing the KGF (Kolar Gold Fields) to explosively choreographing the action sequences to elevating Rocky's character at multiple occasions, they have shown they knew what the viewers wanted, and delivered the promise product without any hassle. I was also glad to see heavy cheering and whistling throughout almost the entire duration, and some credit goes to the dialogue writer as well. The music was also good and delivered without interfering with the storytelling (though one song in the second half wasn't really necessary).

The biggest plus point of the film is its screenplay. From re-introducing our favorite characters and introducing new ones to building up conflicts and backing them with explosive action, KGF Chapter 2 has all the ingredients of a proper mass entertainer. Not a single scene where it feels dragged or overdone. Sure, it does feel long at times, but it never gets boring, and with several twists and turns, the story remains intriguing till the end.

One thing I'd definitely want to tell the viewers is to not simply get up and walk away once the credits start rolling. There is a mid-credits scene, and it's an important one. Other than that, this film should be on your watchlist if you like period action films. In the end, I just feel glad and kind of proud seeing a film I liked in 2018 going on to receive much bigger hype and viewer turnout with its second part in 2022."

                ","After the success of Bahubali phenomenon , many movies are trying to recreate the same. KGF has also tried to do the same by splitting the movie into two parts. But, KGF fall flat in its 2nd part where Bahubali succeeded.

Coming to movie, this movie is all about hype. It's lacks story. It is too noisy. Their are only few dialogues that people will remember. The whole movie looks like a big trailer.

If you are Yash fan then you may enjoy the movie otherwise it can be skipped."

                ","KGF 2 is the best Indian film I have watched this year. Every aspect of this film was giving me goosebumps moments , from the cinematography which presented the in a grade A manner, action sequences which pushes the audience to the edge of the seat, CGI which pins Rocky's KGF city into everyone's mind, the screenplay which never once gave the of feel lag throughout the long duration of the movie, the editing which was on point and BGM the flare to whole of the film. Prashanth Neel and Yash have handled the movie like the precious gold of KGF itself. Not just Yash but every characters played their part in this film disregarding the recurring or new faces in the film, especially Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon whose character came with high expectations. Since I watched the film in tamil, hats off to dialogue writer for the memorable line. KGF 2 clearly one of the best Kannada movies. Its clearly a 10/10 film."

This is the movie that tells the value of the big screen theatre and sounds are required for such movies. Please watch this movie only in the theatres because this gives you the best experience. And don't try to watch in your home."

Storyline and everything is at another level . I suggest everyone to watch this movie because it is one time experience. South has proved that bollywood is nothing in front of South movies.

                ","Neither such a film was made, nor will it ever be made, (both parts) What should I say, if you talk about rating, then 1 point out of 10 is not there to reduce. The story and direction are so tight that you can't even blink and There are so many twists and turns in the story that you cannot imagine. Where the first part of the story ended, the second part takes it to the top. It is very difficult to take the story of any film to another part and above, but the director has done wonders.

When it came to acting, Yash broke all limits in playing the role of a gangster. His style of walking, sitting style, manner of talking, body language and his fight scenes have immortalized him in the role of gangster. Sanjay Dutt looked great in the character of the villain. Rest of the actors have done their respective roles. The cinematography is at the level of the best films in the world. The background music has brought life to every scene of the film. After years, such background music has been heard.

To be honest, I have no words to praise this film. Just this film forced me to write. Please do watch this movie."

                ","I'm not a fan of Yash but l'm a cinephile. My review is based on a general film making perspective. Movie is not so epic, just has over ratings and the over hype. It doesn't contain any brilliant sequences and nothing out of the box. Too much bgm and It's not emotional. Colour grading as more blacks and grey's to get that classic look. People who like the actor Yash will also like the movie because of his good screen presence. It's more like fan based movie and it's watchable. This is my opinion."

Epitome of all Masterpieces. Greatest of all time. Zenith of the medium. Hallmark of media. Gold standard of storytelling. Apogee of creativity. Vertex of invention. Crest of ingenuity. Acme of imagination. Pinnacle of innovation. Epic of epics. Legend among legends. Peak fiction

Can't forget one above all , peak creation , lonely at the summit,goats above goats, grandiose masterpiece, impeccable perfection, too exquisite to exist, unbelievably marvelous creation, spectacularly bewildering and stupendous imagination,work of god.

Groundbreaking and foundational, his sense of development is a deconstruction of employment segregation and the powerful performances are truly comprehensive of their poignant themes while the nuance in the direction complements a layered screenplay.

Pure elegant, exquisite, endeavour. I can't put my finger on what's wrong because there isn't anything, masterful character-making from a masterful person. Top of the decade. Top of the century. Top of my life, it's all downhill now."

                ","Its a wonderfully crafted fictional Mass entertainer. These words would explain the whole movie altogether.

There are two types of movie audience type and critic type. I'm a type of person who loves critic type of movie. But this one here clearly belongs audience and I loved it. I would like to appreciate the director for tricking me to forget abt logic and convinced me to enjoy the Movie irrespective of the flaws it has got. The narrative, Visuals, background score, writing of screenplay are the huge plus factor. He has given more importance to the writing. Screenplay is so engaging that you will have no time to think abt all those logics. Backed by constant BGM and Wonderful cinematography. (they never let their director down throughout movie) I understand if a critic gives less ratings, but you can't deny the fact that adrenaline rush your body went through while watching this movie. I know its not a perfect movie but I love the way it made me feel."

Then started watching KGF -1 again.. I woke up and avoided looking at phone notification or browse through chrome and you tube as I didnt want any information regarding KGF-2 to reach me ... Next day I went for KGF-2.

I reached theater 30 mins before movie time ...These 30 min were very Hard...I wanted to break open the Entrance and wanted the movie to start at the earliest... Once the movie started I sat like I was giving an exam and nothing goes unnoticed on the screen... Concentarion level during movie was beyond imagination... And then came Rocking * Yash ...Once in your life time Movies like KGF are made..N througout your life you wont stop prasing the movie..That is KGF for me.... I missed the Post Credit scene so I will watch the movie again...

Hats off to director prashanth Neel, i must tell you that he is just a beginning of his exceptional direction.

All the charector are so powerful, if you hear negetive review on this movie ? Then I must tell they missed the focus on understanding story line

For the people who haven't watched it yet, please stay focused on every minute of movie. You will love it ! Dance it ! Shout it !

                ","Introduction - A powerful action packed movie with great acting and ultimate direction with clear crystal screenplay that focuses more on the raw action and narration of the story.

Acting and Casting - Yash's acting is at peaks, his rendition as Rocky has been proved in the 1st part itself, but in this chapter, he is more powerful and his swag is all you need to sit in a theatre for more than 2hrs experiencing this masterpiece, other cast also made justice to their roles, Sanjay as Adheera is very good, Raveena as Ramika is exceptional... Even though Prakash did a fair job as the new narrator, I still wanted Anantha nag sir as the narrator.. (his expressions and the hold on language pronounciation is far better)

Direction - This movie is an example of what a great and creative director Prashanth Neel is, he is a next generation director who can take Sandalwood into more of an Original PAN India hub, his excellency in directing this masterpiece and meeting the audience expectations after this much hype is unrealistic, he is a true creator."

Best movie till date that india ever witnessed. Think and expect as much as you can, KGF2 will surpass all of your expectations. The attention to detail from the grassroot level by prashant neel is unmatched."

                ","Prashanth Neel returns as writer-director in KGF: Chapter 2, starring Yash as the gold-hearted gangster named Rocky. But first, a recap. The first chapter was a Deewar-like story of a young boy coming to Bombay and becoming a famous gangster. And then, he is sent to Karnataka, where he becomes even more famous: he becomes the messiah of the people of a secret mining town called KGF. We met Rocky's enemies like Shetty bhai in Bombay and Inayat Khalil in Dubai. We met the Indian Prime Minister, a woman whose face was never revealed, a woman who spoke of unleashing the army on Rocky while signing the death warrant of the man she considered ""the biggest criminal in India.""

But the film began with a television anchor played by Malavika Avinash. She listens to the KGF story as told by a senior journalist, played by Ananth Nag - and that is the same framing device Prashanth uses in the sequel as well. There's just one change. The narrator now is Prakash Raj, who plays the Ananth Nag character's son. I did not realise this while watching Chapter 1, but these conversations provide two things: a breather between the hectically paced events, and they are also a small bit of spoon-feeding for the audience, because the story is so deep and dense. No, let me correct that. The story is fairly uncomplicated. It's the narrative that's deep and dense. And we'll come to this later.

So what does Chapter Two have in store for Rocky? He still cares for his people, who worship him. But he wants them to mine for gold day and night. ""The work should not stop,"" he says. Why? I'll just tell you that it has to do with a mother and a bedtime story she tells her son. Watch the first scene carefully, because this makes the closing images so powerful, so mythical. And between this beginning and this ending, we get a film that works at two levels. One, we get a huge action spectacle with very inventive set pieces, superbly shot by Bhuvan Gowda in dark tones that indicate that we are watching a darker sequel. And two, we get a style-filled masala movie, filled with whistle-worthy dialogue and scene after scene with twists and surprises for the audience.

In Chapter Two, Rocky has two new enemies: the Prime Minister, whose face is finally revealed and is played by Raveena Tandon, and a Viking-style brute named played by a terrific Sanjay Dutt. His entry scene on a burning bridge is one of the film's many epic highlights. In fact, every bit of this film is epic: Yash is epic and wonderfully larger-than-life, the dialogs are epic, Ravi Basrur's score is epic, and the action is epic, especially a car chase that keeps cutting to a black screen - but that is why I wished for some quiet, intimate moments between Rocky and his love interest, played by Srinidhi Shetty. We get an epic moment involving a helicopter, but we get no real idea about their relationship. Their great romance - if it is that - does not register at all. The second issue I had with the film was that the unmasking of the criminal mastermind was done too hastily.

But that apart, I had no complaints, and we can now talk about the narrative being deep and dense. In Chapter One, the combination of the fast cutting and slow motion created a stylised effect. We get some of that in Chapter Two as well, but Prashanth really pushes himself as a screenwriter and he also pushes his editor Ujwal Kulkarni - to the extent that every sequence plays like the legendary baptism stretch from the first Godfather. The visuals come at us very fast, but this is not just the usual quick cutting for an attention-deficit audience. This is carefully planned stylisation. Take the scene where the Raveena Tandon character is sworn in as Prime Minister. She reads out a line or two. And then we see her elsewhere, barking orders to sack the Home Minister. And then, we are back at the swearing-in ceremony. So there is a sense of playing with time. We see her in the present. We cut to her actions in the future. And we return to the present. And there is also a sense of playing with geography, because these two events are happening in two different locations.

This happens again and again. We have a no-confidence motion playing out in the Parliament. Simultaneously, we see a shootout. Rocky's wife has a bad dream. We move to a major action set piece, after which we return to the bad dream being narrated. This closing part of this narration is one of the few genuinely emotional moments in KGF: Chapter Two, along with the opening and closing imagery. But I didn't mind. The action and the masala flavour and the precision of the cuts are fantastic, and even if the story arc feels familiar, the denseness from the screenplay/editing makes it all seem new. Chapter Two improves on its predecessor: it is an epic times two."

                ","I'm not saying that the movie was perfect but for the expectations and the hype it gave with the trailers and teasers are well deserved. I can only sing praises for this movie and I might be a bit biased but I watched the first show at 4am so I deserve to be a huge fan of this. The director is focused on his story and does not make any adjustment or include things that could ruin the storyline just because of the love that the first chapter received. Its a theater experience for sure, a delight to be precise."

                ","I'n not a great fan of mass masala flicks in general but this one hits different. I got literal goosebumps during many scenes and yes,there are some fights which goes over the top but we have witnessed worse ones getting praised so not a big issue there. The only part which feels cringy is the opening sequence (not his entry btw which was lit af) where the female lead feels abducted by rocky but he never minds and continues to throw cringy dialogues at her, barring that,the movie is must watch in theaters."

                ","Before going into deep first I need to tell about the power💪 which anyone can feel after watching this Movie is Great. There is many movies which gives us a positive vibes but till a certain level. But vibes of this movie is extra ordinary.

Now, about the story is the fictional but with mixture of some real facts like kgf (konar gold field) it self called as gold hub of india.

The main highlights of this movie is are it's continutaion of part 1 which engaged the people with it. And it's cinemography, vfx, acting & ⭐Rocking Star Yash ⭐ it's self. The direction of prasanth neel and it's also open the doors for them to become international.

The action sequences of the movie was awesome (not extra just only how much which needed) it's vfx & overall movie colour tone is also done we'll.

Conclusion, Why you need to watch this movie is just simply there is no need but whenever you ask anyone who watched the movie is also recommends you because he's just can't explain you the whole with just the help of words. So you need to experience it itself.

After this movie Yash also become a Brand Rocking Star Yash as Rocky Bhai. I hope he would mantain because it's easy to become but very hard to maintain before him so many actors achieved it but very less able to keep it till end.

That's all now go watch movies rate over it where you reading this review."

                ","Best movie ever. In 2018, the blockbuster film KGF: Chapter 1 got released. Chapter 2 is the sequel to it. Vijay Kiragandur under the banner Hombale Films produces the film, directed by Prashanth Neel. Rockstars Yash, Srinidhi Shetty, Sanjay Dutt, and Raveena Tandon play the leads, while Prakash Raj, Malavika Avinash, Eswari Rao, and others provide supporting roles. Ravi Basrur composed the music, and Bhuvan Gowda handled the cinematography.

This installment of the series continues where the previous episode left off, with Rocky (Yash) as the leader of the KGF. Sanjay Dutt's character Adheera (Sanjay Dutt), who was believed to be dead, wants to take over the Gold Field. Rocky's allies from the first part have become his enemies, and they have also set their eyes on the throne. Ramika Sen, India's Prime Minister, has also declared Rocky the nation's most wanted criminal, and he is pursued by police. Whether Rocky maintains control over KGF and how he handles all these issues forms the plot of the film."

                ","= No SPOILER, nothing. Only talking vaguely and giving my own opinion without any mirch masala. =

Let me be honest and tell you the problems. Lol --- First thing first, I enjoyed the movie. :D Now regarding problems and Over the top actions sequences and many egocentric decisions took place throughout the movie. Even the fact that life of a boy was decided by his mother,even though i won't argue, but still it felt a bit forced, but i know, it's not bad, kinda swayed the whole vibe for me as such things only take place when we think about villains = as in cruel treacherous villains, you know what i mean, right. As we always say, see his past is the reason for him being like that = But for Rocky i have a different feeling. He is more like a Antagonist but not a villain. It's like he has that vibe and the aura. He is like a person you wanna cheer for. So i was always thinking of him as MC. But now i think he is, Anti-Hero kinda being. Which is also my favourite genre btw.

--- Over the top actions could be a bit problematic, but they made it such a fast show of actions that it didn't really bother me. I get that from the first action scene, They are not trying to show me how well he fight.

They are just trying to set the tone and Let people's imagination run wild. Which IMO is a very good way to avoid OTT Action and at the same time having a similar impact, if nothing less.

--- So TBH not much of a problem anywhere.

Latest movies released like, RRR and BEAST.

ALL have problem with logic and actions were so illogical and let's say done with idiocy that i was kinda sad. But still, they all did one thing.

Giving us anime style fight scenes which you can enjoy with popcorn.

But still by the end i has this complaint in my mind. Like, why do this? Why your knee suddenly become allright that you can jump run, while just a min. Ago you can't even walk. How can broken knee just become allright, when soldiers specifically break them and didn't even gave you enough food and so on. SO it was so much, that finally i stopped my brain like It's ENOUGH, just stop. See this as you are seeing anime.

That's it.

OTT Action was much less in BEAST. But still, fighting with sword against soldiers who are fighting with AK-47, and so on. Was so stupid. That again i stopped my brain.

--- BUT in KGF Part 2 and even in part 1. They didn't give that much of a vibe of OTT ACtion going on. Which i loved. So i must say, I love their execution.

That's it.

Believe me, don't go for spoilers.

It's a great movie.

And they made it a fast movie, with blood pumping all around. Adrenaline and everything will just burst. Didn't get bored even for a sec.

I got to see Rocky bhai rise, his fall, even him being egoist and even changing toward this greedy and bad person, and also see how his people tried to bring him back to his previous Rocky, only to get things worse as his enemies attack. And he lost everything. And again he rises.

And as we all know, as a criminal rocky will eventually die. So no suspense in that. But still his journey was worth seeing."

                ","Loads of points in the movie are far fetched, loads of points are unrealistic. But imagine a person within the current society who doesn't give a sh**. He has goal though unrealistic, but the one was set up by his poor dying mother. This movie is about going through things to achieve these pre-destined Goliaths. The protagonist though unreal resembles a multiverse where a common pneumoniac kid destined to die, can grow up to be an inhuman but still bleed driven by a weakness( his humane side )which propels him to save some if not all. Loads of review online discuss about an over the top story, and I agree but my question to them is, why do you watch a movie? To forget your present, sometimes to remember the past, and sometimes to look for the future. Why can't there be a movie which talks about a resembling past (the ravina tondon performance did remind me of our own Iron Lady with all her shortcomings), a motivation less covid stricken present (where every one is confined to their own dark deep mines) and a selfless future (where your being is in commensalism with others). But just forget about all my bull sh**, watch the movie with a lovely sound track, on a Dolby sound, forget about the in-consequentialness of life, and remember the incapabilities of a father to create another Rocky (pun intended). You will get it when you watch the first half. Thanks."

                ",First of all the hype created by the first chapter alone was massive and to live upto that the movie has to be on par or even better than the first one and dare I say it's good because it is truly an incredible movie. Fantastic performance by Yash as no one would've been more suitable to play Rocky Bhai just like prabhas for baahubali. Ravi Basrur is the unsung hero of both the movies. Technically this is an amazing movie. If u miss the opportunity to watch this movie in theatres (IMAX RECOMMENDED) it's ur loss. Watch it no matter the ticket price as it's worth both ur time and money. Also there is a post credit scene do not miss it as it'll hint towards chapter 3.

Bar is set high true kgf fans know that if you are not kgf fan you will after watching this Rocking Star Yash whole movie is a tribute to him what level of acting one of most loved BGM is Fire just fire I can see whole movie without dialog only bgm it is key factor for success of KGF CHAPTER 1 and 2 other actors if I talked it will so much for writing Must Must Must watch In cinemas.

The characters were defined very precisely and each of them have done justice to their role. The protagonist (YASH) has not only amazed the viewers but also has tried to inculcate small small detailing in every min of the movie. The movie was high on adrenaline and was packed with power punched dialogues (which obviously would have made more sense in Kannada, than any other dubbed language).

With a screenplay that was all over the place, characters getting introduced at a pace faster than a meteoroid's crash, and a story that picked up only post-interval, I was a bit lost too early on in the film. It was only Yash's introduction scene and his superlative performance that I thoroughly enjoyed. Also read: Prashanth Neel on KGF 3: 'If people love it, we could continue the franchise'"

                ","KGF 2 Review: 'KGF:Chapter 1' set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.

The film begins with Vijayendra Ingalagi, the son of Anand Ingalagi, taking over as the narrator. Rocky has won over the people of KGF and he is now in the process of dreaming bigger and treading more dangerous paths. In this process, he encounters Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings and evokes visceral fear, who wants KGF back. Simultaneously, he also has to encounter the righteous Prime Minister Ramika Sen, who also wants Rocky taken down."

The best thing about this movie was its direction and background music at each and every scene is mind blowing and sensational... Yash is no doubt a next emerging superstar. The way he carries the tough and angry look is very catchy. Sanjay dutt as adheera is amazing and Raveena as Ramika Sen has played an amazing role of a tough lady.

                ","A prior thing i want to tell you before i write the review :

I am a college student and a hostelier , i was having some work in college but i left that in mid just to come back home and watch this movie . My friends in college says South Indian movies is all about illogical action scenes , no story , i told them before leaving , we have already proved you with Bahubali and many more . I reached home & asked my friends from hometown to come with me for the movie , they showed no interest & urged me to watch Zero , fortunately the only theatre in my hometown is showing KGF movie . So , i went to watch it alone & it's better to go alone than going with friends & getting their negative words for the movie while watching .

Analysis :

Only one line for the movie "" Once in millennia"" From the screenplay to the dialogues , the movie was commendable .

Before the interval

First half is full of action . The entry scene of Yash is amazing . Yash is doing role of character "" Rocky"" . The child actor has done his role at its best . In first half , lot of characters are introduced , you have to remember each and every actor as they have their role further in movie . The first half is story instigator with mind blowing action scenes . A small love story of Yash , and you know that any love story in South India is incomplete without action and same you will get here . In first half what i adored the most , the goosebump giving scene is the last scene before interval . I will not tell you what was that , just go and watch , and i hope you will love too .

...........................INTERVAL.......................

Was too much hungry , as i skipped my breakfast and lunch to come to home from college and without taking any rest , i ran to watch the movie , so bought some chips , cold drink . After interval , some favourite ads of my friends again came.

....................................................................

The second half

The real story began in the second part of movie. I personally like second half more than the first. The second half is what makes me the die hard fan of this movie. Again a lot of dialogues , that song showing mother love for her child Rocky completely caught attention. I am waiting for the movie songs to release especially that ""Sultan"" song. The tremendous work of Yash , his superb acting skills , all are beyond imagination. The terminating part of movie is unexpected and left curiousity in the minds of audience. I think the movie ended at a phenomenal stage, if you will not watch Chapter 2 that's also good , because the Chapter 1 despite leaving some suspense , can say it to be complete. But the story doesn't end here. The movie is elongated for the second chapter of the movie .

For screenplay : 4.5/5

For direction : 4/5

For dialogues : 4/5

Overall rating : 4/5

Review for the movie : A Simple line "" Going to watch this movie again ""

Yes , this movie put a smile on everyone's face and made everyone's day . As , I already said i love the CHAPTER 1 and second part perhaps not required but i also want this movie not to end here , eagerly waiting for the CHAPTER 2

You can hate South Indian movies , but you can't ignore the emerging Yash and KGF . Zero movie is not running well , it's expected that KGF will get more screens , of Zero also .

Edit : Some people are comparing Bahubali with KGF by saying KGF is not even near to position where Bahubali is but on being opposite to their reviews , I like KGF more than ""Bahubali - The beginning "" . It's truth that KGF will be criticized and people are criticizing it too. But what can we say, it's their views.

EDIT 2 : Watched the movie for the second time , still same curiosity."

                ","Speechless terrifying extraordinary best movie in the World. Yash, the popular actor in Kannada cinema, won the hearts of the Tamil audience with the massive action thriller 'KGF: Chapter 1', and the film's dubbed version had a magical theatrical run in Tamil Nadu. Yash is now back with the release of 'KGF: Chapter 2', and the Pan Indian release has hit the big screens today. Due to high expectations, 'KGF 2' has got special shows in Tamil Nadu too, and the film opened with an early morning show. Fans didn't fail to catch the action drama, and they share their reviews on Twitter once they complete watching the film."

                ","IRate : 10 out of 10 ( not a BLOCKBUSTER, a new term penned by me, It's a ""R-O-O-F-B-U-S-T-E-R"")

Extraordinary scenes in Pune as well as even centre like Jamnagar, Surat, Ahemdabad where even 6am shows are Housefull (forget the madness in South)

Well well well, India has got a new R-O-O-F-B-U-S-T-E-R STAR and his name is YASH. KGF Chapter 1 surprised us all by showing the world of KGF in second half. But here in Chapter 2, director Prashant Neel immerses us completely in the world of KGF and from there ROCKY Bhai Yash takes over & rides the journey with many twists and turns with his awesome style, Hollywood level action, Bold charisma, whistle-worthy dialogues, his hard hitting punches & punchlines, delivering a KING-SIZED ENTERTAINMENT !!

KGF Chapter 2 is YASH's ticket to being a CROWD PULLING SUPERSTARDOM ! It's time to pack the bags for Bollywood's Khan's and Kumar's & Kapoor's because after Rajnikanth, this is YASH's time to be a legendary all-time favourite actor of pan-Indian audience for a long long time

Positives : Yash, Yash and Yash. Apart from that, Sanjay Dutt stands out as a menacing villain in a gruesome avtaar and ofcourse, the comeback of Raveena Tandon in a powerful act.

Stunning visuals, Heart-thumping background score, Fast paced screenplay and a suspenseful climax makes this a must watch

Nagetive : nothing."

And also there's nothing new to say about our Sanju Baba he's always been a terrific actor, he once again performed par excellence as a deadly villain in the movie, I'm sure you'll get goosebumps while watching these two giants of Indian cinema. So just hit the theatres asap don't miss it or else you will regret later. It's a worth watch movie better than RRR. My rating for this movie will be 5 out 5."

Overacting by all the actors, Physicsless action scenes, unnecessary bgm the whole time, atleast 10 times entry of Rocky from 4 different angles and slowmo, Eventually every word coming out of Rocky is a dialogue, just to make a hype included us navy and Canadian navy name in the end scene but no sense comes out of it. If you are a fan of South Indian action movies then you will like it otherwise in order to enjoy you will have forget reasoning, physics and stop making sense out of everything that happens in the movie."

Every character holds a significant role and is important for the story. The direction is perfect with the perfect pace of story telling. This includes the elements of humour, action, thrillers and suspence. The movie is entertaining throughout its intirity and is making a spot in my personal favourite movie ever to exist. Rocking star Yash is a blessing to film industry and this film is an example of how capable of an actor he is. I watched this film in Kannada and so miss Sanjay Dutts actual voice, however am going to watch it in Hindi as well just for Sanjay Dutt's actual voice. The movie is something to remember for a decade or maybe a lifetime."

And also there's nothing new to say about our Sanju Baba he's always been a terrific actor, he once again performed par excellence as a deadly villain in the movie, I'm sure you'll get goosebumps while watching these two giants of Indian cinema.

                ","Yash is just outstanding with his terrific performance and unleashes his amazing screen presence throughout the movie. Yash continued from where he left in KGF 1. He carried himself with the same intensity and energy. He looked stylish, raw, and rugged and costumes suited his swag and mannerisms. He showed variations in his expressions turning brutal, ruthless, and menacing at one time and humane, and emotional at other times.

Srinidhi Shetty got a limited screen presence just like her role in the first part. However, she did full justice to her emoting well.

Sanjay Dutt looked powerful evoking fear as Adheera. Though the scenes featuring Yash and Sanjay Dutt are powerfully written, Sanjay Dutt's age showed up on the screen bringing down the intensity levels.

Raveena Tandon looked intense as a powerful politician who meant business while dealing with the anti-social elements.

Rao Ramesh as the CBI officer performed well and Prakash Raj did justice to her role."

There is something outlandish yet gorgeous about the K. G. F franchise that they no longer make such films. That they no longer imagine scenes propelled by absolute madness. After all, K. G. F films are written on steroids.

There is a moment in K. G. F: Chapter 2, where Rocky Bhai (a rocking Yash, bathed and cleansed in masculine orgy) takes a machine gun out to blow up a police station, in the garb of a ""field test"". With a cigarette hanging from his lip, he fires aimlessly to show his prowess as bullets zoom past the station and everything in between. Bullet casings drop to the ground and Bhai walks in slow-motion to light up his cigarette from the gun's nozzle with an equally electrifying background score by Ravi Basrur."

                ","The stars of KGF 2 are Yash and Prashanth Neel. The Kannada superstar's towering personality does full justice to the almost mythical character of Rocky Bhai. Very few stars would have made a role like Rocky Bhai believable and Yash owns it in every frame. Filmmaker Prashanth Neel ensures that the story proceeds at a brisk pace. Sanjay Dutt matches him in presence. Prakash Raj is nuanced as the narrator of the film. Raveena Tandon is impressive and you will wonder why she did not get such roles in her prime. From Rocky Bhai gaining sole control over Narachi to how he makes one quick escape to return stronger, it is one helluva ride. The visuals will linger in your memory for a long time. The team has shot at JSW sites, which gives KGF 2 the canvas of brown, grey and black. Ravi Basrur's scintillating BGM lifts up the sequences and you cannot help but stay transfixed to the screen. Another star of the film is cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda. The aesthetic of KGF 2 is a lot like Mad Max: Fury Road. Prashanth Neel who is part of the writing team ensures scenes loaded with dry humour and witty dialogues. With references to nepotism and secularism, KGF 2 taps into the modern milieu."

There is no way you might get bored even for a second throughout the movie.

                ","There are extraordinary action movies that India has recently witnessed which includes Bahubali and RRR.

But....... The KGF franchise is on a whole other level!!! The movie KGF 2 completely lives up to the hype that's among the audience. It delivers a completely satisfying package of action, entertainment and drama. The Dialouges, the BGM, the cinematography; everything is just awesome. Some scenes can even be matched with hollywood action films.

And of course, the story. The story is so well written and the screenplay is so good that keeps people engaged throughout the movie. Another plus point of this movie which makes it better than other action movies are the realistic elements. The story feels real, the action scenes are practical, the set pieces are real and so are the Emotions that this movie conveys. And this is the specialty of KGF.

Hats off to the director - Prasanth Neel. I had never thought that such a mass movie could be made in India. Kudos to the entire kgf team.

This will be my most fav action movie forever coz I don't really think that any movie can replace the hype that KGF has created."

Sanjay dutt was looking evil in his role and has done justice for his role, Raveena Tandon did a brilliant job. Prakash Rai, Malaika and others were good in their role.

Prashath Neel had done mindblowing job he will be remembered as one of the India's biggest Director in the history of Indian Cinema. Brilliant fiery Screenplay, Excellent Direction. We are used to witness elevations in between story but we feel that story is in between elevations. Pure goosebumps stuff throughout the movie. Hats off to neel for pulling up this Marvel.

Chapter 2 follows the story of Rocky (Yash), an orphan rising from poverty to become the king of a gold mine. The first film came out in 2018. In addition to Yash, the sequel features Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon and marks Sanjay Dutt's debut in Kannada films. KGF: Chapter 2 also stars Prakash Raj, Malavika Avinash, and Srinidhi Shetty, among others.

About starring in the film, Srinidhi told PTI in an interview. ""I couldn't believe I had received the opportunity. I was going for the homecoming ceremony (after the international pageant) and this was the first project I got. I went for the meeting, and Prashanth narrated the story and my character.

With this behind me when watching KGF 2 it gave me the proud happiness atleast 10 times, icing being the reveal in the end.

Prashanth Neel kept his words and wrote such a Marvellous script. Some fools may say that KGF Chapter 2 is terrible, but being a movie lover I really loved the content. This really did well above the expectations and I really loved it. This movie is only made for action movie lovers only, Family sentiment and love story movie lovers will surely dislike due to it's action scenes. That's because these guys ain't have brain and Intelligence Quotient in their brain to understand this movie. Better I recommend them to watch love story/ Family Sentiment movies rather than Action Movies like KGF Chapter 2."

                ",I have seen this movie today and i was unbelievable guys you all should watch it but i must say for those people who have sentiments related to reality don't mind because when you go to see the movie you must leave your brain at your home because if you are gonna to theatre you should be ready to watch those cinematics scenes. Don't offend and don't think how can a person do that because that is fiction and is not related to reality. For example there was a scene where he would enter the parliament with weapons and people get offended by this scene and saying how can I person directly enter to the parliament and make pm afraid. Grow up guys.

                ","I have watched KGF 1, without any expectations and KGF 2 was otherwise. It just connect a common man who has worked hard to become successful and wanting to conquer the world is portrayed as if a common man struggling in his daily life to achieve it. It just connect to the masses so instantly and people just sitting inside theatre making themselves believe that they are living the character.

I was gobsmacked how people were reacting to the movie with their emotions.

Coming to my heading this movie can very well destroy Bollywood. The dialogue (nepotism) in the movie fits very well for Bollywood as if, someone has hit Bollywood on their back with big stick.😉"

                ","The screenplay, cuts and sound effects deserves a standing ovation. There are illogical moments but that don't take away you, because the Director keeps you invested in the 'state of disbelief' and that is the success of this movie. There is hardly any sugarcoating to the criminal angle of Rocky, and it is more of a man with a promise to fulfill. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for a honest 'masala movie...."

Note : Don't miss the post credit scenes and choose a proper theatre for an awesome audio visual treat.

Yash performance is an career best.

Prashanth Neel is an maestro in clicking the emotions of the masses and elevations in the movie is top notch.

As a Indian movie goer few logic needs to be kept aside but there even that is being kept in mind and seen through.

Twists and plots is very exciting.

Finally kudos to Hombale Films for bringing out the best and showcasing Kannada Film Industry to the world.

I can see the name of Farhan Akhtar who has his name associated with beautiful movies like Milkha Singh and many more is a part as well some how.

The Theatre sound system was terrific. It was giving a glimpse of Bourne Identity movie action sound system. I have never seen such kind of loud sound system in my life.

Yes ofcourse there are few illogical moments but that's the beauty of his direction. His direction will keep you away from those moments. Your attention will only be on that scene. The build up behind those scenes are amazing. Brilliant cinematography. Kudos to the cinematographer 👏👏👏👏. Let me now talk about the performances of every actor. OMG!! Yash, Yash and Yash amazing performance. Apart from that, Sanjay Dutt stands out as a menacing villain in a gruesome avtaar and ofcourse, the comeback of Raveena Tandon in a short but powerful act. Brutal action, top notch performances, Stunning visuals, Heart-thumping background score and the climax makes this a must watch.

Completely mind blowing movie a total power packed package. And the climax makes this a must watch.

                ","Compared to KGF Chapter 1 the Chapter 2 is not what I expected. The movie's story and narration takes a big chunk of excitement and it upsets me a lot. Half time into the movie, the movie felt just ""Boring"". There is fantastic background music and hero elevations through the screen time. But the lack of coherence In the story telling combined with some very fast paced editing make the whole thing feel uninspired and gore. It feels that the movie could have done much better story-wise. Overall, it's watchable, but not memorable."

                ","The film showcases the life and journey of Rocky after he kills Garuda in Kolar gold fields. The film is beautifully shot and every scene is a treat to watch. Director and writer Prasanth Neel's vision is superb and he presented the vision in such a manner that it is wholesome of entertainment along with every minute detail which is awesome as a viewer and movie fan ... The film is shot on a very large scale as it's main character Rocky is larger than life and the film leaves no point prooving that .. although it's a fiction but spending almost 2:45 min in theatre every single person is in awe of the protagonist Rocky as well as other characters ... And finally rocking star Yash.. needless to say it's one of the strongest and lived character we all have seen in past few years in Indian cinema..... No Bollywood , no tollywood , no Kollywood ... Kgf chapter 2 and even 1 is Indian cinema which is roaring in all over the globe and making us Indians proud bcoz the magic this film has created within a 100 crore rupees budget it's a treat to watch."

I can safely proceed to state that my expectations were not only met, but also surpassed by this fine sequel.

Srinidhi, Sanjay Dutt and Raveena Tandon's powerfull performance was also something not to miss. Last but not least Prashanth Sir's mind is mind-blowing, nobody could have done it better than him. 😅😅 Literally cannot forget the scenes and music and the whole action and everything, it's been passed 2 days i watched it on big screen, gonna watch it again and take my family with me too.😁 You guys don't wait for it to play on TV rather go to theatre and watch it now so that you don't regret later on. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"

                ","There are a couple of things to keep in mind while watching this movie. Firstly, this genre of movie is not meant to please everyone. Some might feel senseless action and flying cars which do not obey the laws of physics. This movie is not for the hypercritical. This movie has a very unique factor which is the strength of this film, which is the entertainment factor. Go to this movie leaving your physics book at home to watch fantastic visuals and very quirky conflict-ions which you might not get to see in any other genre. The strong points of this movie are Cinematography, BGM, and over the top dialogues. It is hyper dramatic and loud. But that is the style of this movie . It is more like a graphic novel made with real life action setting. Definitely go and watch this movie with your gang to have a ball , chill out, experience the bloody, cool and over the top action film like you enjoy a DWAYNE JOHNSON film. Don't try to make sense of it's quirkiness. That is the point of the movie ."

Falsehood story seems to be a little more true when presented so creatively and beautifully. That should be the case with the film. As I expected or Much more than I expected. So good Direction!!

                ","Uff! The movie started with goosebumps and ended with goosebumps 😉.

The story progresses at a brisk pace in a racy tale of Rocky's journey to the top. The film, like the first part, presents a dark, dreary world that is stylishly shot. While the first part took time to prove who the protagonist was and included more time to establish the same, this second part moves quicker and one gets to meet more characters. The conflicts and battles are more interesting this time."
